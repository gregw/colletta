The origins of the settlement go back to the thirteenth century.

The village, completely uninhabited for about the last thirty years, was the subject of a restoration project which has operated on two levels. On one level, a general restoration of the ancient settlement was in progress, respecting the original materials and building techniques (the restoration plan was developed by the architect Giancarlo De Carlo).

On another level, the village has been provided with a sophisticated technological infrastructure which will allow future inhabitants to benefit from the widest possible range of telecommunications resources. In this way they will be able to enjoy the peace and isolation offered by the village - as well as the beauty of the surroundings - while staying in touch with the work environment and, more generally, with the information resources available all over the world. Thus it will be possible for people to spend long periods in Colletta; periods which do not necessarily have to coincide with official holidays. People will have the chance to "telecommute", or even decide to move their primary residence to Colletta.
