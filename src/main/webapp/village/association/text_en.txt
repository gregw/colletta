The association was founded in 1998 to support reconstruction of the medieval village of Colletta di Castelbianco.   Now that the work has been completed the association is finding renewed life through the new owners in the village. The aim of the association is to encourage cultural and social activities, respecting the long history and beauty of the village. 
Some examples of recent activities of the association are the organization of various events such as the Photo Competition and its associated calendar, Colletta Day with its celebration of local food and wine & the Olive Festival where the olives from the trees on the terraces are harvested by the villagers and their very own olive oil produced. The association aims to improve the quality of life within the village and to maintain its cultural and environmental heritage. 

Culture is an important heritage which can sometimes be submerged beneath technical advances. It has no social boundaries but is something which must be felt both by the individual and by the community as a whole. It should be something which underpins the ambience of the village.

The stones of Colletta, the "Ancient Stones", give the real character to the place. Merely touching them and sitting on them provokes a strong sense of the long history and culture lived in the village. The vision of the original developers has succeeded in constructing a beautiful and tranquil place, where time seems to stand still, uniting the past and the future, where you can breathe and revive your spirit.

The ancient stones have been carefully preserved and used to reconstruct the buildings, telling their own story of everything that has gone before in this valley, with Colletta at its heart. 
The Valle Pennavaire is the cradle of Liguria. The fossil remains show that humans have lived in the caves bordering the river that gives it its name for over 9000 years. They say that our predecessors, well before Christianity, worshipped two Gods, the God Pen whose name is still found in the mountains on the left of the high valley on a rocky apex, and the God Belen from whose name derives the borders of Liguria, in dialect "Belin"; the evidence is a man-made rock sculpture in one of the caves. The holy places of this religion were later used by Christians who built small chapels there. The stones tell us of the ancient Romans who left signs of their passage, when  people had abandoned cave dwelling a long time since. They tell us of the roving bands of Saracens coming from the powerful Arab states, using their bases in Spain and their main local base in what is now St. Tropez, infiltrating  the whole Ligurian coast and reaching into lower Piemonte. They tell us of the carriages of Del Carretto, who passed through these roads to reach the hunting reserves nearby. If we concentrate and listen with our heart we can hear the sound of the wheels coming into contact with the stone. They tell us of the passage of Napoleon's rampaging troops. They tell us of the peasants who with devotion, sacrifice and toil have cultivated the land into terraces, helped by the donkeys and mules used for transporting the fruits of the earth for century upon century.   But..... what the Ancient Stones tell us are not just the dates and factual events of the past. They tell us about the emotions of all who have preceded us, their loves, their disappointments, their conquests, their devotions, their hopes, their aspirations, their despair, their grief, the inheritance of all of us who are products of the past. The present would not exist without the past, we are all linked in some way to those caves, and it's our duty to continue this connection until those ancient stones can speak again to those who want to hear. They will tell of the feelings of those who are fortunate enough to walk through the lovely lanes of Colletta, appreciating the aromas of  Giorgio’s delicious cooking, of those who stay to eat at the Osteria after an aperitivo at the Telecafe, of those who admire the many fine works of art on display, of those who immerse themselves in the natural beauty and enjoy the steady concert from the cicadas, of those who imbibe the perfume of nature and who take its benefit.
