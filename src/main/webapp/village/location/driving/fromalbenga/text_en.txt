Emerging from the motorway toll, keep on the left and pull up to the stop sign. Watch out for traffic coming from the left. Cross to the other side of the road and go left. You will follow the signs to Castelbianco where they exist, but otherwise follow those for [Garessio] for a while. $$

You go towards the hills, back under the motorway and straight over a roundabout, passing various office buildings and large stores (UniEuro, for example) before the road becomes more countrified. $$

You then pass Cisano Sul Neva and at the end of the tiny village of [Martinetto] you must turn left over a small bridge at the Esso petrol outlet. You will now be following the sign towards [Castelbianco], not Garessio any more. This turn off is 5.7 km from leaving the motorway. $$

Now follow the directions [[../frommartinetto:from Martinetto]].
