All major routes to Colletta converge at Martinetto. $$
$$
There is a petrol outlet at the north end of this tiny village, and you must go over the small bridge alongside it. It is signposted for Castelbianco.

You now leave civilisation behind for a while, passing a couple of ugly, dusty quarries, but the scenery does gradually improve and you will not be disappointed when you get to Colletta!

Follow the road along the river valley and after 7 km (8-10 mins) you should see Colletta close above to the right on the top of a small hill. Don't take the turn off for Vesallo and Veravo. If you do you will still get to Colletta but via a very long route above and back down again.

You should go on for about another kilometre and take the next small road on your right - which brings you directly up to Colletta. You will find this road signposted Oresine and Colletta. On the corner there is a small hotel/restaurant named Scola.

Not far up the hill you will see Colletta on your right, and then the public car park just above the village round the corner past the little church.

As you walk down into the village you will arrive at the red door of the bar in the tiny little piazza (A Ciassetta). On the way down the steps you pass Giuliaâ€™s office, and if she is there introduce yourself. Otherwise go into the bar where you wiil find Cristiano.. Basic English will be understood, and communication will take place one way or another! Everyone is very helpful and nice.
