!Directions to Colletta from Pisa Galileo Galilei airport

The distance to Colletta by the autostrada is about 250 kilometres, and on a clear run driving at the maximum speed limit the journey takes about 155 minutes. The toll charge is €19.90.

After emerging through customs, the car rental desks are ahead of you slightly to the right.

If you fancy something to eat, there are a couple of good places at the airport itself on the upper level. See [[/region/restaurants/furtherafield/tuscany/pisa/:Pisa ristoranti]].

To pick up your car, exit the terminal building, turn right and pick up a shuttle bus that takes you the short distance to where the rental carks are parked. Show your rental envelope to the driver so he knows what company you are using, and he will stop at the appropriate zone for you. Having picked up your car, retrace the short distance back to the airport and then follow the green signs for the [A12/E80 to Genova].

You follow the road below and alongside the flyover for a few hundred metres, and then bear right going under it and ascend the ramp that turns back to join it. After a couple of minutes you will pick up a ticket at the toll and join the A12 in the direction of Genova.

After about 166 km (90 minutes), as you approach Genova, follow the signs for [Ventimiglia, Aeroporto and the A10]. Be careful not to get carried off on to a right fork for Milano. You then go through a tunnel that narrows to one lane at the end, after which the road becomes twisty as you pass through the outskirts of Genova. Just after a short tunnel take the right fork signed [Ventimiglia, Aeroporto, Alessandria] after which you will cross a long bridge and go past the turn off for Genova airport – it is best to be in the left hand lane at this point to avoid traffic joining the autostrada from the slip road.

Now follow the directions [[../fromgenova:from Genoa]].
