The village of Colletta is situated in the Western Ligurian hinterland, in the province of Savona, in the district of Castelbianco, twelve kilometres from Albenga. The hamlet lies on a rocky ridge, about three hundred metres above sea level, in the middle of the Pennavaire valley.

It is in the tail of the Maritime Alps, yet only a short drive from the Italian and French Riveiras.
