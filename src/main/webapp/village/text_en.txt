The village of Colletta is situated in the Western Ligurian hinterland in the province of Savona, in the district of Castelbianco, twelve kilometres from Albenga. The hamlet lies on a rocky ridge, about three hundred metres above sea level, in the middle of the Pennavaire valley. The origins of the settlement go back to the thirteenth century: the oldest parts of the village have been dated to this period.
