Colletta offers a range of accommodation to suit your needs, from a simple hotel-style room, to larger suites with living areas, to apartments with fully equipped kitchen and able to sleep between 2 and 6 people. Our management staff take great pride in their work and treat each visitor to Colletta as if they were a guest in their own home. We offer modern hotel-style services such as room cleaning and linen.  But Colletta is neither a resort nor a hotel, but rather a living village that combines ancient architecture with high technology to offer the visitor a unique and unforgettable experience.
