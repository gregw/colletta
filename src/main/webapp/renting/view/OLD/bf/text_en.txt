This beautifully decorated one-bedroom apartment is in the heart of Colletta, by the village square, and a step or two away from the wonderful Osteria.

Flat BF has a modern, well equipped kitchen, with full oven, two-ring hob and fridge and dining area for four. The white washed open-plan living area includes a comfortable double sofa-bed, a flat screen TV and home cinema for DVDs, CDs and MP3 connection. Underfloor heating throughout provides comfort for stays in autumn, winter and spring.

A home office area has a hand-crafted desk, perfect for laptops, and the apartment has wireless connection to high-speed broadband.

The terrace features magnificent views of Peso Grande, the 1023m mountain opposite the village. There is also a more private porch area for enjoying breakfast and morning coffee.

It should be noted that there are no steps inside this apartment and there is easy access from the entrance of the village.
