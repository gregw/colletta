The master bedroom has a double bed with a spacious walk-in cupboard and small table and chairs. In the large living room there is a sofa bed and 3 armchairs which can also become 3 comfortable single beds, plus a large wardrobe. The bathroom is very roomy with a good-sized shower, basin, WC and bidet. There is a small well-equipped kitchen next to the living area with a table and chairs for inside dining.

Rosmarino has 2 small grassy terraces with spectacular views over the village and mountains and an outside table and chairs for sipping a glass of wine on a warm summer's evening.
