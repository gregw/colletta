This is a simple studio apartment in a separate building close to EA Uva with its own shower room, a kitchenette and a sofa bed sleeping up to 2 people.. It has a small terrace outside and has stunning uninterrupted views from the window over the Pennavaire valley. It is on the edge of the village in a very peaceful location but is just a short distance from the swimming pool.

It should be noted that while the apartment is all on one level there are steps up to the front door.

EA1 Rifugio can be rented either in conjunction with EA Uva or on its own, perhaps as a perfect base for a group of climbers.
