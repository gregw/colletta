A lovely studio flat ideal for one person, or for two people on a short stay in the Village - such as a long weekend or a short break.

It is in a quiet spot, just round the corner from the internet-caf√©-osteria and the central piazza of the village.

There is a refrigerator and a sink - enough to prepare a salad, sandwich or snack and a coffee or a tea.
