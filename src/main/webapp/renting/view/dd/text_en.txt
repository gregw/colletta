Torre is one of our most lovely apartments with spectacular views from the roof tower.

The entrance is up two short flights of steps with the door opening into a long living/dining room with top quality furnishings. There is a leather seating unit, a dining table and chairs seating 4 people and a small desk and chair suitable for a computer. There is also a unit with a TV, DVD player and a WIFI router. The room has windows with beautiful views over wild countryside.

There is a separate designer kitchen up a couple of steps with oven, hotplate, fridge freezer and dishwasher and all the equipment you will need for your stay.

Downstairs the 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms are to be found. The smaller bedroom has a sofa bed which can be configured either as a double bed or 2 singles. There is also a wardrobe in the room. Two steps take you down to the main bathroom with a large bath tub and hand held shower. Again all the bathroom fittings are of the highest quality.
Further down the corridor there is the master bedroom with king-sized bed, large wardrobe and en-suite shower room.

There are parquet floors throughout the apartment with marble floor tiles in the bathrooms. Under floor heating in all rooms provides comfort for stays in autumn, winter and spring. 


Outside there are more steps up to 2 stunning roof terraces with an uninterrupted view of the village and surrounding mountains. One terrace is equipped with a wooden table and chairs seating 6 people plus 2 wooden sun loungers. 

It should be noted that there are steps up to the entrance to the property and again up to the terraces, plus internal stairs within the apartment.
