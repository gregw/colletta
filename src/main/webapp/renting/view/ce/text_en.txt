This is a spacious and interesting 1-bedroom flat located in the heart of the village with easy access to the Osteria/bar, the laundry room and the swimming pool (seasonal).  Under floor heating in all rooms provides comfort for stays in autumn, winter and spring.

This apartment is comprised of a master bedroom, a kitchen area, a bathroom and a small open-plan studio room.  The kitchen unit is cleverly hidden within a large wall cupboard.  This efficient kitchen space contains all the basic necessities for your stay and also offers exposed beams overhead and a skylight to brighten the room.  A few steps down from the kitchen you will find a studio area with a sofa bed.  Another few steps from there you will find the bathroom complete with a shower (no tub).  The opposite side of the kitchen is the large master bedroom with a double bed and many built-in closets.  

There is a lovely terrace and garden just outside of the master bedroom.  The views from both are of the Pennavaire valley and the beautiful local mountains.  A perfect spot to rest and relax. 

The Fico apartment is perfect for a family (2-4 people) or a group of friends. 

It should be noted while the interior of the apartment is virtually on one level, there are several stairs externally to the terrace and garden.
