This is an attractive 2-bedroom apartment located near the edge of our village and close to the swimming pool (seasonal) that offers peace & quiet as well as beautiful views of the valley. Under floor heating in all rooms provides comfort for stays in autumn, winter and spring. 

This apartment is comprised of two bedrooms, a bathroom and a large living/kitchen area.  The kitchen area is well organized and equipped with all the amenities you will need during your stay, inclusive of a large refrigerator/freezer and a dining area.  The living area is comfortably furnished with a pullout couch and includes a TV and a DVD player.  Just off the kitchen area is a second bedroom (or study) complete with a sofa bed, a desk and wireless PC connection. Just a few steps from the living area you will find the master bedroom and the bathroom complete with a shower (no tub). 

The garden terrace, complete with table, a bench, 4 chairs and a large fixed parasol is  located just outside of the front door and offers panoramic mountain views.  A fabulous spot to dine al fresco or to relax and enjoy a glass of wine after a days hike.  

This charming apartment is ideal for a family of 4-6 people, 2-3 couples or a group of friends.  It should be noted that the interior has a few steps (down to the bedroom) but that externally there are steps needed to access the pool and the common areas.
