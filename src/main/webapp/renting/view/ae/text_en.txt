This apartment is one of the largest and most spacious at Colletta, facing the village green and with its own oliveto (olive grove).

It is strategically situated close to the village entrance. The front terrace, which receives the morning sun, overlooks the central piazza where the village bar/osteria is only a stoneâ€™s throw away. On the opposite side, the apartment has direct access to the largest private garden in Colletta; an olive grove with 18 trees on two levels, plus its own rose and herb garden. From the master bedroom and the kitchen/dining room there are excellent views of the valley and the amphitheatre below.

The apartment itself is virtually on one level. It is comfortable and furnished in a contemporary way within the medieval walls. The kitchen has been completely renewed and there is also a new dishwasher. The floors are white marble with timber in the bedrooms. Underfloor heating in all rooms provide comfortable stays in autumn, winter and spring.

It can accommodate up to six people, two in each bedroom and two in the lounge, where the sofa converts into a comfortable sofa bed.

The apartment is ideal for families for short and long stays, but also for couples who are looking for a romantic getaway in spacious and serene surroundings.
