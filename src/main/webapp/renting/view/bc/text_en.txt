A beautiful south-facing two bedroom apartment with a full kitchen, a garden,  a sun terrace and its own associated olive grove.
All the windows receive sunshine and have excellent views.

There is a large double bed and lots of storage in the main bedroom. The second bedroom can be configured 
with a double bed, two singles or as a study/office and has its own entrance.
The sofa with its ample chaise longue also converts into a comfortable double bed.  There are two 
complete bathrooms with a shower upstairs and a bath/shower in the other.

Appliances include air conditioner, underfloor heating, 
dishwasher, oven/microwave, washer/dryer, DVD, LCD TV, Sky Digital pay TV, broadband Internet connection, WiFi hub and printer.
3 or 4 can eat around the breakfast bar and the designer coffee table easily converts into a dinner table for 8.

Outdoors on the terrace and in the garden, there are tables and chairs for al fresco
dining with stunning views. The well maintained garden and lawn includes flowerbeds, kitchen herbs, 
climbing roses and a shady olive tree.  A 50m stroll down the hill brings you to the associated Olive grove, with a private picnic table and there are often fresh cherries ready to eat from the tree.

It should be noted that this flat is on two levels and there are stairs within the apartment.
