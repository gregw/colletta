This is a lovely and intimate studio flat that offers easy access to many of the village conveniences, yet quiet and private.  It is just steps away from the South entrance (very convenient for dropping off and picking up your luggage) and not far from the village centre where you will find the Osteria and the main square. This flat offers electric heaters to provide comfort for stays in autumn, winter and spring. 

The main room is tiled throughout and offers a double bed, a small living area and an efficiency kitchenette complete with all you will need for your stay.  This room also features a stereo system and an Internet connection. The bathroom is complete with a large shower and a waterfall showerhead.  There is a private garden terrace just outside the front door that offers fabulous views over the Pennavaire valley.  It is a perfect spot for morning breakfast or to relax and enjoy an afternoon glass of wine.

"Rosa"is ideal for a romantic holiday just for two.  It should be noted that this apartment is completely on one level but there are some steps nearby in the village before accessing the front gate.
