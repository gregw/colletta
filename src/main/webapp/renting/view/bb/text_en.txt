This is a lovely and intimate studio flat that has been finished to the highest standard. It is situated behind the small piazza and not far from the Bar/Osteria.  

The apartment has parquet floors throughout and offers a separate studio room with pull-down double  bed and table and chairs, plus a small wardrobe and storage space for clothes. This room also features a TV and an Internet connection. There is a well equipped kitchenette with two hot plates and a microwave oven. The good-sized bathroom is complete with a large shower and elegant sink with ample storage space for toiletries.  There is a large terrace just opposite the front door that offers fabulous views over the Pennavaire valley. There is a table and 4 chairs plus a barbecue - the perfect place to relax in the evening and enjoy a glass of wine.

Glicine is mostly on one level though there are a few steps down from the front door and up to the kitchen/bathroom area.
