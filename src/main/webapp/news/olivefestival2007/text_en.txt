Colletta's annual Olive Festival was held this year from November 30th to December 2nd.$$
Despite a poor crop we managed to harvest enough olives to give everyone participating a few bottles of our own unique olive oil.$$
The weather was glorious and the picnic and chestnut roast, provided by the Osteria Colletta, took place in warm sunshine.$$
We enjoyed excellent meals at the Gin and Scola restaurants in the company of many old and new friends.
