Colletta's annual Olive Festival was brought forward this year and was held from November 6th to 9th.$$
This proved to be a good idea as we had an excellent harvest and  managed to collect more than 250 kilos of olives of a very high quality.$$
We enjoyed wining and dining at Scola, Gin, Garello and of course in our excellent Osteria Trapassatomoderno, with friends both old and new$$
