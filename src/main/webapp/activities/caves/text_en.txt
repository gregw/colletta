There are some very famous and interesting caves ([[http://www.toiranogrotte.it:Grotte di Toirano]]) not far from Colletta.

To get there, leave the A10 motorway at Borghetto S.Spirito (next exit east of Albenga) and follow the signs for Toirano (3 km).

While you are there, take a look around the old town of Toirano itself.
