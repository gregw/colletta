The climbing area around Castelbianco is a newly "discovered" area that has been given the nickname Oltre Finale, meaning the Other Finale Ligure, after a famous climbing area nearby.  There are many climbing areas around Colletta and in the valley of all grades and difficulties.  Some are just a 5 minute walk from the village, while others are at the end of adventurous treks into the mountains.  A German climbing site described the climbing area as:

[Quote:"Near the famous rock climbing spot Finale Ligure in Liguria, Italy, you  will find Castelbianco in the Pennavaire valley.]

[Quote:Even if sport climbing routes was set up 12-13 years ago the area can be regarded as brand new. During the last few years hundreds of new climbing routes has been made.]

[Quote:  The area is beautiful and has potential to be developed to one of the biggest rock climbing areas in Europe."]
