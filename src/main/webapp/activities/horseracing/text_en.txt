The [[http://www.ippodromodeifiori.com/:Ippodromo]] is adjacent to Villanova d'Albenga airport. Go to the roundabout at UniEuro and take the first exit (right), going along the bypass road (Aurelia bis) towards Alassio. Take the second exit (Villanova & Garlenda) and turn left at the T-junction. Very soon turn right up the small slope outside the stadium. Parking and entrance is free. Children are admitted.

The trotting is from April to October, and the galloping from November to March.

For evening meetings the races begin at around 20:45 and the last race is at midnight, with about half an hour between the start of each race. Most races go one and a half times round the oval track, covering a total of 1600 metres, and there are normally between 6 and 14 runners for a trot. 

The minimum stake is â‚¬1. Give the number of the horse and say 'vincente' if you are betting for a win or 'piazzatto' for a place. Alternatively, 'accoppiata' is a forecast (first two) and 'trio' is the first three.

Naturally there is a restaurant/pizzeria there, and it starts serving around 19:15, getting very busy by about 20:00. The food is quite acceptable - all the usual stuff, including meat and fish - and the antipasto buffet is excellent. However, you had better not expect your food to be delivered in any particular order unless you make a big issue of it up front with the waiter.
