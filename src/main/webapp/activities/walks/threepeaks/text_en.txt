Castelbianco is surrounded by three peaks over 1000m : M. Lapeu (1001m), M. Alpe (1056m) and Castell Ermo (1092m, aka Peso Grande) that form a 10km triangle around Colletta.  The [Castelbianco Three Peaks Challenge] is an informal race against the clock to visit all three peaks.

The course of the challenge starts and finishes in the [[/village/cafe:bar la Colletta]] and the summits of the three mountains may be visited in any order without assistance from car, bike, paraglider etc. Times are measured on by an honour system, but good times will need witnesses and photographic evidence to be believed.

Unlike the other three peak races in [[http://www.sleepmonsters.co.uk/site_3peaks/:Scottland]] and [[http://www.threepeaks.org.au/:Tasmania]], you don't need a yacht!

Send your times to gregw@wiltel.org to have them listed on this page.  We also welcome suggestions and/or donations for a suitable trophy to be kept by the walker with the fastest time.
