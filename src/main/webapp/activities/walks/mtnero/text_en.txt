This walk starts as a [moderate] walk along old mule paths in the forest, but ends up a [sporty] exercise in path finding to reach the col between Castel Ermo and Mt Nero by the direct route.

The first hour of the walk up follows an old mule path that is easy to follow, but the pavement is mostly gone. For 30 minutes the path stays close to the Cotte stream, before starting to zigzag up to the top of the ridge.   If you find yourself on a level track above the main road, you have left the stream to early.   As you approach the top of the ridge, there are many old terraces and a few ruins around a spring.  Above the spring there is a small rocky clearing with view towards Colletta and several paths leading up the hill.  The path to the left takes you into the pine forest.  You want the path to the right, which is a bit overgrown at this point, but you will soon find your self again following an old mule path which is often a wide grassy track. Stay high above the stream and if you come to a crossing then you have missed the main path higher up the ridge.

After an hour of walking, the mule path ends at a small level manmade platform.  From here the path is small an hard to find. The route heads high towards the cliffs and then turns right over several small steep creeks.   Eventually you reach a steep grassy slope that takes you all the way to
the col (pass).  From here, tracks lead in several directions into the Arrioscia valley and beyond.  There is a small church 10 mintues along to path towards Castel Ermo.
