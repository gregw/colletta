This newly cleared path links two community paths.  The lower section may be used as a pleasant alternative to walking on the road to ristorante scola. The upper section is a bit steep and sporty but visits some excellent old stone walls and irrigation works to complete a loop via the path from Nasino.

Take the path leaving from the Walnut tree below Colletta heading west. This path decends to the valley floor road and crosses the last working irrigation aqueduct in the valley. Just before the dogleg turn to the aqueduct, the new path diverges to the right through a large patch of rosemary.

The path meanders through mixed forest with wild mushrooms, thyme and sage to be found, before crossing the Colletta access road just above Ristorante Scola.

20 meters down the road, the path steeply ascends the hillside and is a little rocky underfoot.  Good shoes and a sporty outlook are needed for this section.

You pass many old terraces that 30 years ago were irrigated potato fields, but are now hassle forest. At one point, the path skirts a rocky outcrop with a "lion king" style view of the valley. This point used to be a man made water fall to provide spring water from the stone tank behind to the terraces below.

The path joins the sentiero to Nasino just below the climbing walls and near to a second stone tanks for spring water. Take the level path to the right back to Colletta.
