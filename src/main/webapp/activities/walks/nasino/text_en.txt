A 1.5 hour [moderate] walk along an [easy] to follow mule track takes you to the village of [[/region/district/pennavaria:Nasino]].  The  track starts behind the church at Colletta and follows the contours through open old olive groves and among the ancient terraces with good view back towards Castelbianco and across to Castel Ermo. Several rock climbing walls are above the track 10 minutes from Colletta.

Allow time to explore Nasino.
