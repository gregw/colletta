There is a wonderful water park at Ceriale ([[http://www.lecaravelle.com/:Le Caravelle]]) - children absolutely love it!

It's about a 20 minutes drive from Colletta. Go past Cisano Sul Neva, take the left fork towards Ceriale and just before coming into Ceriale you will see signs directing you to turn left. $$

For those who want to do straight lengths there is an all-year pool at the south end of the Albenga sea front, open from 09:00 in the morning to late afternoon, and again in the evenings. The address is [Stadio del Nuoto di Albenga], 1 Via Amalfi Tel 0182.554332. They also have hydrobike sessions and numerous courses and classes, such as Acqua Fitness and Acqua-gym. $$
