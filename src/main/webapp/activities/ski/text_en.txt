The maritime alps have many small and medium ski resorts catering for most grades of skiing.  Several resorts are a short drive from Colletta and can be visited as a day trip.

There is a website with information about the nearby resorts at [[http://www.simolimo.it:www.simolimo.it]] (italian only).
