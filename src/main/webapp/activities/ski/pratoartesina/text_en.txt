Thanks to olympic funding, the  resorts of Prato Nevoso, Artesina and Lurisia being are linked (see [[http://www.mondole.it:Mondole Ski]]), which will result in 180km of pistes and 40 ski lifts only 30km from colletta, complete with thermal baths!  Unfortunately that 30km is as the bird flies and a 100km road trip is required to reach this great resort.
