This small resort is only a 49km (beautiful) drive from Colletta! 
While it currently only has two drag lifts, these rise to 2200m and serve a surprisingly
large area with excellent off piste skiing.  Open only on weekends. There is a bar, a restaurant,
a hotel and ski hire. There are plans for a chair lift, perhaps in 2007.
