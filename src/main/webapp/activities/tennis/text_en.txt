The majority of the courts are clay, but are well kept. $$

[Castelbianco Sports Centre, Vesallo] $$
This is under construction alongside the road above Colletta - just five minutes away by car. When completed there will be a bar and facilities for roller skating and five-a-side football.

[Coasco] Marina Verde Tel 0182-582007 $$
Just before Villanova d'Albenga - probably the easiest courts to get to from Colletta. Turn right on to the Alassio bypass road at the roundabout just after UniEuro. Come off at the first exit, heading towards Pieve di Teco and Ortovero. You will see the bubble (indoor court) from a distance on a small hill. Just past the turnoff to Arnasco on the right, pull in to the right and go through what looks like a car park in front of a few shops. Follow the twisty road up the hill. There are also two outside courts. The surface is carpet.

[[http://www.tennisalbenga.it/:Albenga Tennis Club]] Via Isonzo Tel 0182-52642 $$
This is hidden away in the back streets of Albenga in a turning off Via Dalmazia. There are two outside clay courts, and two with a course plastic grass surface squeezed into tents. There is a clubhouse and some rows of banked benches for watching.

[Ceriale (Borgo Mediterraneo) Tennis Club] Via al Campo, Via Romana Tel 0182-990936 $$
Take the left turn after Cisano, heading towards Ceriale. Turn left at Via Nava after passing the water park (Le Caravelle) as you are approaching Ceriale. There are three outside courts and one in a tent.

[Andora] Via S.Angela Tel 0182-86753 [[http://www.atletikasportclub.it/index.php:Sporting Atletika]] $$
Not far from the autostrada exit. A good club.

[Alassio] Via Buonarroti Tel 0182 640174 [[http://www.hanburytennisclub.it:Hanbury Club]] $$
Behind the railway station. Numerous courts. Very classy.

[Tennis Club Garlenda] Via Borgo Ponte, Via Roma 111 Tel 0182-585028 $$
Coming from the direction of Albenga, this is on the left beyond the village of Garlenda. There are three rubberised ashphalt courts, one of which is within  a spacious open-sided tent, and there is a club house with a small restaurant and bar where you can sit and watch. Every July they have a mixed-doubles tournament where you play with a padella (frying pan)! $$

[Loano] Via Aurelia Tel 019-669055 [[http://www.tennisclubloano.it/:Tennis Club]] $$
At the far end of the town. They have frequent tournaments here, and sometimes you can watch a high standard of tennis being played. The club house serves good snacks too! $$

[Bastia] regione Abissinia $$
This facility is on the other side of the main road (Via Paccini) from the church with the tall spire. There is a clubhouse and a single clay court, both somewhat lacking in care and attention. $$
