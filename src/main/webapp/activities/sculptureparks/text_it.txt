There is a dramatic set of large sculptures in a garden beside an ancient tower at Vendone (near Arnasco) which is well worth a visit. There are about twenty large standing stones decorated with lines and geometric figures.

This is the [[http://www.rainer-kriester.de/:Rainer Kriester]] sculpture park, known as [[http://www.amicinellarte.it/index.php?idservice=211&idi=10254&idpar2=16:'The Garden of Stones']]. For more information on the artist [[http://www.officinae.net/eclettica/?module=displaystory&edition_id=4&story_id=709&format=html:click here]].

[Colletta] has its own sculpture park sponsored by the Noble Foundation, and the first work (the 'Snowball') was placed on exhibit in 2008. In 2009, 'Behind me' won the prize, in 2010 "White Gazelle"  was the winner and in 2011 "Wavespell".
