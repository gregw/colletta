!Val Pennavária
Colletta is situated within the unspoilt Pennavaria valley, stretching from the Maritime alps of Piedemont to the historic town of Albenga on the Italian Riviera of Palms.  Ancient hillside stone villages are perched on the sunny side of the valley among terraces of olives and cherry trees, facing the rocky peak of Castel Ermo. The local produce keeps the valleys restaurants in excellent supply of ligurian delights. There is excellent walking, often along ancient mule trails as well as climbing and cycling routes.  The villages of [[pennavaria:Nasino, Alto and Caprauna]] are all worth a visit.
