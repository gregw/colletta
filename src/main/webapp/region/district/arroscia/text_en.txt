Cosio di Arroscia is a tiny feudal village perched in the mountains of the Arroscia valley, in the hinterland of [[albenga:Albenga]] surrounded by fields of lavender and grapevines that produce the region's famous Dolcetto wine. Another defensive feudal seat of the powerful Clavesana family, the village passed into the hands of the Republic of Genoa in 1274. Of particular interest are the many covered passages that allow the inhabitants unhindered movement around their village, even when winter snows cover the land, and  the occasional trompe l'oeil decorations.
