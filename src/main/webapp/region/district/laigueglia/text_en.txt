Laigueglia is a pretty pastel coloured village whose centre still preserves its ancient Ligurian layout. The church of San Matteo is beautiful, and local tradition has it that the two crosses atop the tower face into the two prevailing winds (the maestrale and the libeccio) to protect the fishermen of the village whilst they are searching for coral, the trade in which was particularly important to the village in the Middle Ages.
