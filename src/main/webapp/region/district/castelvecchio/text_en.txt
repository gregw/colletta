Castelvecchio di Rocca Barbena is perched in a stunning location in the mountains of the Neva valley. The medieval houses cluster in a circle around the base of the castle, which was built in the 12th century as fortification against the raids into the interior by the Saracens, and is nowadays privately owned. 

Over time, the inhabitants of Castelvecchio had drifted away from the old village into newer housing in the surrounding areas. However, much of Castelvecchio has today been reconstructed and reinhabited. The architecture is noteworthy for its mixture of mediterranean-style terracotta roofs and typically ligurian narrow winding stone stone streets and windows with decorative plaster surrounds.
