Albenga is one of the greatest cities of Roman origin on the Rivieria di Ponente, and has one of the best preserved old centres. There are numerous reminders of the Roman times still visible in the valley, and particularly along the roman road that leads to Alassio, the  Via Julia Augusta. The old town of Albenga is rich in medieval towers and houses. The River Centa runs alongside the city walls, and the nature park at the river's mouth is an ideal spot for observing the many sea-birds of the area.

The old town is now going through a phase of revival, and many of the historic piazzettas are being sruced up. A charming feature is 'I Caruggi degli Artisti' - a number of the narrow alleys on the west side of the centro storico are lined with paintings, many of them directly on doors or walls.
