!COOP Supermercato 
In the [[http://www.leserre.com:Le Serre]] shopping center at Regione Bagnoli 37, Albenga (on the SS 582 near the new hospital). [[http://www.coop.it/:Coop]] $$

This is the nearest major supermarket to Colletta. You get there by going past the autostrada junction, straight on through the traffic lights towards Albenga, and taking the first exit at the roundabout - which takes you on to a straight one-way road beside the river. Turn left at the small black & yellow sign about 500 metres along. There is a large car park with more parking spaces up on the roof. You will always be able to find a space!

Open Monday to Saturday from 8.30am to 9pm, and on Sundays as follows: 
* from March to October during daylight saving time 8.30am-1pm then 4pm-9pm, otherwise 8.30am-1pm then 3pm-8pm
* in December open from 8.30am-9pm.
