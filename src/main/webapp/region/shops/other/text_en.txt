!Touch & Go (Tel 0182-595067)

This is in Via Benessea, the main road past Cisano going towards Albenga.  It is on the same site as Hello Moto.

You will find all sorts of clothing items, at reduced prices.  It's pot luck - you might well find something you fancy, but equally you might not.

!Officina Factory Outlet

This is on the SP582 on the opposite side of the road to the Coop (Le Serre centre), about 250 metres further back towards Albenga. There is a variety of clothing items at reduced prices (normally 50%), many of which are from top designer labels.

!Giallo

This is in Albenga at the roundabout at the end of Via Pontelungo adjacent to the centro storico. It is a shoe shop stacked with mid-range items at very good prices. If you select three pairs they will give you the cheapest pair free! There are also branches in other towns.
