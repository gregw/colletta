You can get the wines produced by 'Pippo' direct from the estate - Pigato (white) and Rossese (red). Go down to the traffic lights in Leca (just beyond the autostrada toll), turn right towards Bastia and then first right again. You'll find it on your left - if you go under the autostrada you've gone too far! $$

You can go to the Sartori estate and visit the wine bar before making your purchase. You go down towards Albenga, and turn left at the roundabout just past UniEuro. A couple of hundred metres along, just as you start to go up the hill, turn to the left through some gates and into a long driveway leading to an old turret - which is the wine bar and shop. You can get Vermentino, Pigato, Rossese, Lumassina etc.

This lovely wine shop is in the budello (the main pedestrian shopping street). It is not a place for plonk, but for fine wines at a price!
