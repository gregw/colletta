!Colletta
The [[../../../services/cafe/:Bar]] at Colletta is, of course, the place to hang out while in the village. In summer you can sit outside and take in the breathtaking view of the mountains, while watching everyone coming and going through the piazzetta. Or, if you want, you can sit inside and have a chat.

!Leca
For cakes, chocolates and pastries [[http://www.dolceangolo.it/:Dolce Angolo]] in the main street in Leca is an exceptionally good place for such things. They also do Easter eggs and boxes of home made chocolates, and they will wrap them so beautifully that you will hardly be able to bring yourself to open them. There is a room at the back where you can sit and have a coffee – with or without a cake.

!Cisano sul Neva
The [[/region/bars/barneva/:Bar Neva]] in Cisano is a convenient place for a coffee or a drink on the way to or from Colletta, and in the summer it is very nice to sit outside at a table in the square.

!Albenga
For a beautiful modern bar try ['A cafete a'] in Albenga, Viale dei Mille, a little way down from the centro storico in one of the main streets leading to the railway station. It is quite easy to pass this one by without noticing it. There are a few tables outside, protected from the traffic by an elegant canvas structure. You can get some serious wines here, or a glass of champagne, and the food tidbits are excellent.

On a warm evening, the lively [Caffe Noir] (Piazza G.Marconi on the lungomare) is very nice for a drink. A bit further along the lungomare (south, towards Gallinara) there is the all-white [B Side] at the top of the beach, at the back of which you can get a very nice calming view over the water and the bay. In between, on the other side of the road, is the popular and trendy [Caprice]. For a good view, try the roof terrace at [Bagni Miramare] which is just south of B-side.

In the Albenga centro storico, Piazza San Michele, you can sit outside at [Caffe Carpe Diem] and soak up the historic view. If you are interested in whisky, they have about fifty different types to try!

For a quick, cheap and unexpectedly good caffé, cappuccino or spremuta (freshly squeezed juice), try the bar just inside the entrance at Centro Commerciale Le Serre (the Coop mall).
