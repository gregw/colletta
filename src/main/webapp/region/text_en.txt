Colletta is ideally [[/village/location:located]] in the heart of Europe, between the mountains and the sea, near to both modern playgrounds and ancient monuments.  

The tranquil Pennavaire valley is ideal for walks along wild mountain paths and visits to local restaurants to sample the delicious food of the region. Yet, it is only a short drive to the beaches and night life of the Italian Riviera, the slopes of the Maritime Alps and the many other attractions of the area.
