[Wine Bar]

At the roundbout near UniEuro turn towards Salea (left, coming from Colletta), and then take the [second] turning on the left almost at the top of the little hill, opposite a large entrance to a warehouse site. Going along this tiny lane you'll immediately see the solitary tower straight ahead, surrounded by cypress trees and a vineyard - in which you park! $$

This estate is owned by Sartori, a local wine producer (not to be confused with the larger producer of the same name in the Venice region), and the staff are family members. They can speak English, and are very welcoming.

The range of Sartori wines is available plus a few other local ones, and you can buy bottles to take away. There are also other items such as chocolates and jars of artichoke hearts, etc. $$

It's a very beautiful rustic setting for a drink in the evening.
