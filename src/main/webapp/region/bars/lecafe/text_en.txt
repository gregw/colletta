Via Pieve di Teco, 6 $$

This is in the very short street that branches off into Leca at the traffic lights on the main road just south of the autostrada entrance. $$

Being in a rarely traversed street, it goes mainly unnoticed except by locals. However, it is unexpectedly modern inside, and is a good place for a pit stop before or after a motorway journey - or after a bit of food shopping in Leca high street. $$
