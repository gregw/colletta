You can hire a car at your airport of arrival. An alternative is to come to Alassio by train and hire a car or a motorbike/scooter from there. There are buses from Genoa and Nice airports to the train stations.

This is for motor bikes and scooters. The showroom is out the back of Alassio not far from the roundabout where the aurelia bis road begins. In high season a 50cc scooter costs Euro 35 per day, and a 125cc scooter costs Euro 45 per day.
