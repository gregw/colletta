!Weather
There are a number of web sites offering weather predictions. Some of them, however, are wildly inaccurate. The following, although they are often not unanimous, give the best general picture for Albenga. Colletta itself can be a little different to Albenga â€“ having an unpredictable micro-climate of its own. The sunniest place in Western Liguria is Alassio, but the sea front in Albenga is not far behind. $$
