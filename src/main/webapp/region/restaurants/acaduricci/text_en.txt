This the most recently opened eating place in the valley (summer of 2010), situated just before you get to the post office not very far at all down the valley. It is family-run, and they serve home grown produce prepared in the local traditional way. There's no need to speak Italian because the food just comes - a couple of plates of antipasto, two pasta dishes, and two meat dishes. You do have to choose the wine, however - but 'red' or 'white' will suffice! $$

I offer one piece of advice. The pasta comes harder than anywhere I have ever been before, so I suggest you ask for it to be cooked a few minutes more than usual. If you are not Italian, then hopefully they will understand that anyway without having to ask! $$

Felice, who serves, has spent his life in the fields and knows his food. He is very lively and affable and will make you feel very welcome. Manuela, his daughter, is in the kitchen doing a fine job. $$

The total experience is rewarding and the price is right.
