$$Dining Style: [[../reviews:4]]. From Colletta, Da Ferruccio is about 3km down the valley road towards Albenga.
There is no menu and no English spoken, but neither really matters
since the only things you will be asked are whether you want natural or
gassed water, and, perhaps, whether you like snails (lumache). The food
just comes - a number of fairly filling antipasto dishes, a primo and a
mixture of grilled meats.
