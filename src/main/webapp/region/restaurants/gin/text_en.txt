$$Dining style: [[../reviews:8]]. Gin is on the valley road directly below Colletta (opposite the Farmacia/Chemist). There is a path that goes straight down the hill from the village, but it is quite steep, bumpy underfoot, and hard to navigate in the dark. Otherwise drive down to the valley road, turn left and drive for about half a kilometre towards Albenga. There is a car park on the right just before you get there, and also some spaces on the left just past.

The food is based in the local traditions but caters for modern and sophisticated tastes. There is a good selection of wines, and the home-made ice creams are stupendous!
