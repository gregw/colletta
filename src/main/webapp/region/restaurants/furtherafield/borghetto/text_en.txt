This small town is strung out along the coast between Ceriale and Loano. At the South end, it has a very small centro storico that has some charm, but there is very little else to merit a visit except for Trattoria Orazio!

If you are coming North along the aurelia (coastal road) from Ceriale, Piazza Libertà is the first piazza you see on the right (the sea side), and you may be lucky enough to find a parking spot there. If this is full you can go North a hundred metres to the traffic lights and turn left to find a larger car park down the second turning on your right.

If you have come off the autostrada at the Borghetto exit, go straight towards the sea (ignore the sign directing you to turn left for the aurelia!) and you can try the car park down a road on your left just before you meet the aurelia, or you can turn right along the aurelia and try in Piazza Libertà which will be a hundred metres along on your left.

([[/region/restaurants/reviews:3]]) This is in the South East corner of the piazza. It appears to be very small, but there is a large room at the back which tends to be packed and chaotic. The food is simple, but delicious! There is no menu, and you will be told in rapid Italian what is available and will be expected to make an instant choice. The thing to do if you don't speak Italian is to look at what other people are eating and point at what you fancy! You choose and eat the pasta dish before selecting a main course – for which you will generally be offered a choice of sea food dishes. If you want something else you will have to specifically ask for it and you may or may not be lucky! When you have finished, you go and take coffee standing at the bar by the entrance and at the same time pay for your meal. You will be surprised how cheap it is! Recommended. <tooc, May 2006>
