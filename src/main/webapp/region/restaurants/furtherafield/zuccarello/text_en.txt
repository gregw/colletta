Zuccarello is the next village past Martinetto on route towards Castelveccho and Garessio. It is small but charming, with a single main street along which there are covered vaulted walkways either side. This village is rather different to all the others around, and is worth a visit.

There are a couple of bars and some restaurants:

([[/region/restaurants/reviews:5]]) This is a B&B just beyond Zuccarello, in a recently restored building. They are not geared up to serve large numbers, and for such it is essential to book well in advance and to negotiate what you will eat. However, if you do drop in there will always be something on the go for you to eat. You will get a friendly welcome, and you will eat Ligurian dishes prepared from locally sourced food. In the summer you can sit in the open in shade. Nice and relaxing! <tooc, April 2009> $$
