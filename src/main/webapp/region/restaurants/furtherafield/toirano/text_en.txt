To get here, leave the A10 motorway at Borghetto S.Spirito (next exit east of Albenga) and follow the signs for Toirano (3 km). $$

Toirano is a village with a small but interesting centro storico in which there is a well kept [[http://www.toiranogrotte.it/museo/museo_index.html:museum]] that is worth a visit. Nearby there are some [[http://www.toiranogrotte.it/:grottos]] that are a popular attraction. $$

([[/region/restaurants/reviews:7]]) This is near the car park at the south end of the town. There is a tiny room inside that accommodates about 20 diners, and a sunny terrace outside for use in the summer. There is a restricted but interesting menu of meat and fish dishes, and a more extensive pizza menu. The service is very warm and the dishes, though appearing simple, are excellently prepared and presented. The home made desserts are also very good â€“ try the 'seadas'. A good experience at a reasonable price. <tooc, November 2008>$$
