There is a very long stretch of pebble beach here (most of it public) along the Promenade des Anglais. At regular intervals of about 200 metres there are bar/restaurants below the promenade at beach level. These are very nice places for (an expensive) lunch.

The old town here really is restaurant heaven, and half the world seems to know it. The place is wall-to-wall with restaurants, yet by 12:30 at lunchtime you are hard pressed to get a table anywhere. Sea food is the local speciality, and excellent it is too!

This particular branch of heaven, however, is only for the rich! Reckon to pay twice as much as in Italy.
