([[/region/restaurants/reviews:8]]) This fine restaurant is just a couple of kilometres north of Torino Caselle airport, and is very convenient for a visit before taking your flight. If you are coming from the south, take the next turn after the airport, and follow the signs that you will see as you come into the small town.

The food is identifiably Piemontese, but there are many modern and creative twists. English is spoken.
