This is a thriving old town with its own traditional palio on the third Sunday in September in Piazza Alfiera, taking the form of bareback horse races amid grand pageantry. This is one of the few large towns where you can normally find an easy parking space - in the enormous Piazza Campo del Palio. For a motorway journey taking just under two hours, go via the A10 and fork left onto the A26 just before Genoa. At Alessandria take the A21 to Asti. $$

([[/region/restaurants/reviews:8]]) Take the southbound road (Corso Savona) from Piazza Campo del Palio, signposed for Canelli, and turn left after about 1km, just before the bridge over the river. The restaurant is alongside the river, but unfortunately without a view of it. Nevertheless, it is very peaceful, the air is nice and fresh, and on a hot day you can sit outside in one of the marquees under the shade of the trees. There is also a very nice room inside, and an enoteca behind in small but lovely restored and refurbished old building. The food is of a high standard, the portions are quite large, and the price is reasonable. Recommended! $$

[Il Convivio] (Via G.B.Giuliani) Tel 0141-594188 $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:6]]) This is tucked away in a small alley in the central area not far from Piazza Campo del Palio, near the cathedral, and is popular for a quick lunch with local white collar workers. There is a small menu of typical regional dishes, served in a small but stylish salon. $$
