[[http://www.cherasco2000.com/:Cherasco]] is 10 minutes from the Marene/Cherasco turn off from the A6. After exiting the A6 toll you will find yourself on the A33 motorway. Come off at Cherasco (the second exit), and follow the signs up the hill. You will find yourself driving along the main street of this beautiful historic little town. $$

Alternatively, come off the A33 at the first exit and follow the SP662 eastward, going straight across a roundabout beneath a flyover and following the signs at the next two roundabouts. You will go down a steep hill, turn right at a roundabout and then go uphill following the main road (SP661). 

There are large antique markets here in March, September and December, as well as various specialist markets at other times (cars & bikes, ceramics, books & maps, toys, ...). There is a market for top quality organic produce in November. It is also the centre for the cultivation of edible snails!

There many restaurants and osterie, and there are also two fine pasticcerie ([[http://bacidicherasco.com/:Barbero]] and [[http://www.chococlub.com/pasticceria/ravera/index.html:Ravera]]). $$

[[http://www.operti1772.it/:Operti 1772 Da Fausto]] (Via Vittorio Emanuele, 103) Tel 0172.48.70.48 $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:9]]) Driving along the main street, at the town centre turn north into the beautiful Via Vittorio Emanuele and if you look carefully you will find the restaurant just past the arch-covered footway on your right. You have to ring the bell to get in!

It's a beautiful room with the walls and ceilings completely covered in classical murals. Among the dishes are many Piemontese specialities. Try the bigne, which are fine pastry balls filled with creamed asparagus, covered in a cheese sauce. Snails feature largely when in season.

[La Lumaca Osteria & bar] (via Cavour 8 / via S.Pietro) Tel 0172-489421 (closed Mon & Tue) $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:7]]) The bar is in the main street under the porticos, but the main entrance to the osteria is via some steps going down to the cellar from the adjacent side street. The room is vaulted in brick, and furnished with wooden tables and chairs in a rustic style, and the food is similarly authentic - and delicious! This is the pinnacle of osteria food, with an excellent and reasonably priced wine list to go with it. Family run, and hospitable. A must to try. <tooc, Oct 2008> $$

[Osteria La Torre] (via Garibaldi 13) Tel 0172-488458 $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:6]]) This is on the main street near the main square under an arched covered walkway. Only the (very reasonable) prices are shown outside, the menu being relayed to you by one of the waiters (who will jovially attempt to do so in a mixture of English and German if your Italian is not up to much!). It is family run and very popular – hence a notice hanging on the door ready to be displayed saying “we are full!”. The menu varies day by day and season by season but is firmly based on the local traditions.  The food is truly excellent and the atmosphere convivial. You have to try it – really! <tooc, Febraury 2009> $$

[Il Canovaccio] (via S.Pietro 32) Tel 0172-488431 (closed Mon)  $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:8]]) This a light and spacious retaurant, with an inner courtyard in the open air. The ambience and the food are contemporary, which makes a change in this area steeped with tradition. <tooc, Oct 2008> $$
