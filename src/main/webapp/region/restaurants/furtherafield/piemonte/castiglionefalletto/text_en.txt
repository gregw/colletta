This is one of many beautiful hilltop towns in the Langhe.

To get here coming from the direction of Torino, leave the A6 autostrada at the Marene/Cherasco exit and head towards Alba on the SS231/E74, passing through Roreto and Bra. Just north-west of Alba, join the tangenziale going south towards Barolo on the SP3(bis). You pass the turn off to Roddi, go through Gallo d'Alba and then pass the turn off for Grinzane Cavour before turning left up the hill to Castiglione. 

Alternatively go via Pollenzo and [[/region/restaurants/furtherafield/piemonte/roddi/:Roddi]] on the SP7, coming out just north of Gallo d'Alba.

If coming from the Savona direction, come off the A6 at Mondovi and head towards Barolo and then Alba.

([[/region/restaurants/reviews:8]]) This is at the top of the town just below the castle, where there are a few parking spaces. You go down some steps into a lovely courtyard and through the double glass doors on the left into the reception room. There is a T-shaped dining room with large semi circular windows with a wonderful view across the surrounding hills of the Langhe. In fine weather you can eat on a beautiful outside terrace with a stupendous view across to La Morra. The food is regional in style, skilfully prepared and served with pride. English is spoken. Recommended. <tooc, March 2007> $$
