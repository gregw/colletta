This interesting old town is just to the West of the A6 autostrada about 15 kilometres South of the Torino tangenziale. $$

([[/region/restaurants/reviews:6]]) This is a lovely, cosy, friendly little restaurant tucked away in a side street off the main piazza of the centro storico. The food is somewhat different to the normal fare, and eating here is an enjoyable and interesting experience. <tooc, April 2006> $$
