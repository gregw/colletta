Diano d'Alba is about 35 minutes from the Marene/Cherasco turn off from the A6. After exiting the A6 toll you will find yourself on the A33 motorway. Come off at the first exit and follow the SP662 eastward, going straight across a roundabout beneath a flyover and following the signs for Cherasco at the next two roundabouts. Following the SP7, you will go down a steep hill and straight across a roundabout towards Pollenzo. At the next roundabout turn right into Via della Piana which takes you over the river Tanaro. Soon after, take a small left turning just after crossing a stream where there is a sign marking your entry into Verduno. $$

Keep going (passing Roddi) and you will come to a junction with the SP3(bis) just North of Gallo d'Alba. Go straight across and take the old road (SP3) southward towards Gallo and Grinzane. You will see a left turn for Diano d'Alba - take it and ascend the twisty road into the town centre. $$

([[/region/restaurants/reviews:4]]) This is an old family run hotel and restaurant in the centre of town. The food is traditional home-cooking in style and is surely the top example of its kind for miles around - and at a very modest price too! The rooms are comfortable, if plain, but are excellent value. There is a car park right outside. Don't look elsewhere! <tooc, October 2008> $$
