This is quite a large sprawling town, with a small centro storico surrounding a short and narrow main street flanked with porticos.

You can come off the A6 autostrada here and reach Colletta by going towards Garessio and up over one of the two passes.

([[/region/restaurants/reviews:6]]) This is a small and rather drab looking chalet at the end of a car park at the bottom of the hill on which stands the centro storico. However, there is an unexpected quaintness and a warm welcome awaiting as you enter. The food is fresh and is all prepared in the small kitchen by a devoted chef  - nothing defrosted and no bought-in desserts here! Recommended. <tooc, Nov 2007> $$
