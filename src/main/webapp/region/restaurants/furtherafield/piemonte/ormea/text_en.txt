([[/region/restaurants/reviews:7]])  This is towards the bottom of the main (but narrow!) street of the centro storico leading downhill from the town's central square, which is alongside the main road. The food is traditional in style, and is served with pride by the proprietor. Everything is very good, but some of the dishes are fairly salty.
