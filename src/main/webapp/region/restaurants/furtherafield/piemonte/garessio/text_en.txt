You reach Garessio via Zuccarello and the San Bernardo pass, about a 50 minute drive from Colletta. $$

[Ristorante pizzeria San Mauro] (Via Montegrappa 49) Tel 0174.81247 $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:3]]) This is on your right just as you come down from the pass into Garessio Borgo Maggiore. It is in an old building with lots of rustic character, and in fine weather they do a rough and ready barbecue outside on the patio. The food is straightforward and unpretentious - but very enjoyable! $$
