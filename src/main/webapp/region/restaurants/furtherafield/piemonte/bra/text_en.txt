Bra is 15 minutes from the Marene/Cherasco turn off from the A6. After exiting the toll you will find yourself on the A33 motorway. Come off at the first exit and follow the SP662 eastward, going straight across a roundabout beneath a flyover and then following the signs (SS231). You will be approaching the town from the South. $$

There are many restaurants in this sizeable old town and, encouragingly, most of them display the [[http://www.slowfood.it/:'Slow Food']] emblem!

[Osteria del Boccondivino] (Via Mendicita' Istruita 14) Tel 0172 425674 $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:7]])  This is in a side street near the central Piazza XX Settembre, where you are likely to be able to park, and is in a lovely quiet courtyard next door to the headquarters of Slow Food. The rooms and furniture are in traditional style and the food is strictly traditional Piemontese, and good value. This is an excellent place for a stylish and enjoyable dining experience! It is one of the few restaurants in the town that remains open in August. $$

[[http://www.ristop.it/:Ristop]] (Rio Colore Est, at the A6 motorway service area near Bra) Tel 0172.490024 $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:2]]) On the A6 Torino-Savona, this is not far South of the toll gate at Carmagnola. It's actually on the North bound (East) side, but it is connected via a tunnel to the South bound carriageway. It has a restricted menu of plain dishes, and is self service. But the food is OK for what it is, and it's cheap! $$
