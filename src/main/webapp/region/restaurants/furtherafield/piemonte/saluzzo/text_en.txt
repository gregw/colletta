This is a large and grand town, with a centro storico built up on the side of a hill. There is a large and wide pedestrian shopping area with plenty of bars and eating places. $$

([[/region/restaurants/reviews:8]]) This is quite hard to find. It is on the way up the hill in the centro storico, and you will need to ask directions. It is at the top of the 'portici scuri'. The interior is very open, modern and smart and has an all-glass arched window overlooking the little piazza. The food is sophisticated and pricey, but this is probably justified given the total experience. While you are there you might well want to take a look around the house above which was the home of a famous writer and patriot. <tooc, October 2008> $$
