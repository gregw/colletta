This is an old spa town, with fountains in Piazza Bollente that run with constant steaming hot and sulphurous waters. The journey takes about 105 minutes. Either (1) follow the A10 beyond Savona and fork off left towards Alessandria on the A26, coming off at Ovada and following the SP456, or (2) come off the A10 at Albisola (just past Savona) and follow the SP334 going North. $$

([[/region/restaurants/reviews:4]]) This is in a side street in the centro storico, accessed via a small courtyard. It is in a white-painted cellar-like room with vaulted ceilings, with very little natural light. It serves honest and enjoyable local dishes at a reasonable price. $$

([[/region/restaurants/reviews:7]]) This is in a street leading off Piazza Bollente. It is quite stylish, with a garden separating it from its enoteca next door. The menu is sophisticated with prices to match. $$
