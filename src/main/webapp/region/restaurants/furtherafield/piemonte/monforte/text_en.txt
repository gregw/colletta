This is a small hilltop town not far from Barolo. Come off the A6 at the Mondovi junction, and head towards Alba on the SS28DIR/SP12 (signed for Bastia).Then at first follow the signs towards Carru, then Farigliano and then, for a while, Alba. Then, take a right turn at a roundabout onto the SP159 through Monchiero, turn left at a T-junction onto the SP661 and then shortly fork back on the right onto the SP57. It takes about 25 mins from the autostrada turnoff. $$

The road arrives at the main square, where you can sit for a drink at the Grappolo d'Oro, and you will likely be able to park in the street alongside. $$

([[/region/restaurants/reviews:9]]) This is just behind the main square opposite the church. You enter via a little courtyard garden (where you can dine on request), and pass through a cloister into one of two fine period rooms overlooking the valley. You will be formally received, shown to your table and served with courtesy by uniformed waitresses. The dishes are regional, but elevated in style, and the price is consistent with the quality of the total experience. $$
