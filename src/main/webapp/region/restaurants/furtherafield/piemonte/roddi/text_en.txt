Roddi is 25 minutes from the Marene/Cherasco turn off from the A6. After exiting the A6 toll you will find yourself on the A33 motorway. Come off at the first exit and follow the SP662 eastward, going straight across a roundabout beneath a flyover and following the signs for Cherasco at the next two roundabouts. Following the SP7, you will go down a steep hill and straight across a roundabout towards Pollenzo. At the next roundabout turn right into Via della Piana which takes you over the river Tanaro. Soon after, take a small left turning just after crossing a stream where there is a sign marking your entry into Verduno. At a small roundabout turn right into Via Alba and go up the hill following the narrow road into the town. $$

From the top of the hill you can see Alba just a few kilometres away, and La Morra on another hilltop across the valley.  $$

([[/region/restaurants/reviews:8]]) This fine restaurant is run by the very dedicated Danilo and Daniela. Danilo worked in Charlotte street (London) many years ago, and understands a bit of English.

For antipasto, the fonduta in a little bowl of crispy parmesan, and the cotechino pasties with a chick pea sauce are both excellent. For primo, the tagliolini al tartufo bianco are very comforting and easy to eat - yet also quite filling! Maybe share a plate between two. For secondo, the lamb cutlets are beautifully cooked to remove any of the strong flavours you sometimes get, and the fried eggs with white truffle are something unusual (and delightful) to try. The hazelnut desert is excellent, and not too sweet. All the dishes are prepared with great care and attention, and with an understanding of how to bring out the best in the ingredients. And it all comes without any pretensiousness - to which, actually, Danilo would be quite entitled! Highly recommended.
