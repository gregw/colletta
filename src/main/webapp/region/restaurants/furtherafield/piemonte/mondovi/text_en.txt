Mondovi is not far off the Autostrada A6, and is worth a detour for a meal and a quick look round the shops and the centro storico. It's also not far from Cuneo. $$

[Ristorante Tre Limoni d'Oro] (Piazza Cesare Battisti) Tel 0174.40333 $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:7]])  This is on the corner of a piazza among the shopping streets in the centro storico. It has a traditional air about it, with uniformed waiters and waitresses, but is not oppressively formal. The food is traditional piemontese, and is excellent.
