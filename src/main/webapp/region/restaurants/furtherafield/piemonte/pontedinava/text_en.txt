This small village is on the main road between Pieve di Teco and Ormea. On the north side of the bridge there is a small parking area alongside the river opposite which there is a provisions shop that many find quite an attraction. However, less obvious, on the south side there is a much larger parking area from which there is a footbridge across to the main street.

([[/region/restaurants/reviews:8]]) This restaurant is within the hotel 'Ponte di Nava' on the main road through. From the outside there is nothing to suggest the refinement or the welcome that greets you when you step inside! The hotel lobby is immaculate, behind which there is a beautiful sitting room with a nearby bar. Further through there is a large dining room with a view over the river and the surrounding mountains. The food is traditional and at the same time refined, and must be one of the finest examples for miles around. The home-made desserts and chestnut ice cream are sensational. And it all comes at a very reasonable price. Highly recommended. <tooc, November 2008> $$
