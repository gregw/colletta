This is a town a little west of Torino and just south of the A26 which runs through the Susa valley from the Torino tangenziale to the Frejus tunnel leading through into France.

It has two shallow lakes â€“ Lago Grande and Lago Piccolo. Lago Grande is surrounded by a number of hotels and restaurants, but Lago Piccolo is undeveloped apart from a small beach and snack-bar at one end.

A stunning landmark nearby is the [[http://www.sacradisanmichele.com/:Sacra di San Michele]] perched on a peak overlooking the Susa valley.

At the beginning of September every year there is the [[http://www.jazzfest.it/:'due laghi' jazz festival]].

This is on the south side of Lago Grande near the Santuario della Madonna dei Laghi. It is a pub-restaurant with a terrace providing an excellent view over the lake. The food is ordinary, but the location is excellent. <tooc, September 2007> $$
