The restaurants in this town are not easy to find. Driving in and parking is also not easy, made worse by the impatient, impolite, intimidating, opportunistic and arrogant drivers that populate the roads here!

To drive in to a reasonably central spot, from the A6 carry straight on towards Torino Centro more or less following the river. Go straight across any roundabouts and follow the road as two lanes bear slightly left down an underpass and come up at Corso M. D'Azeglio where there are a few petrol outlets in the middle of the road. At the end there is a T-junction at Corso Vittorio Emanuele II, at which you should turn right. You could go over the river, turn left and come back over at the next bridge, or stay this side and turn left alongs its flank (Corso Cairoli). Either way you will arrive in Piazza Vittorio Veneto (at the end of Via Po) where you stand a chance of finding a parking space.

Torino is a renowned centre for gastronomy, and there are a number of events held here during the year. For example, the [[http://www.salonedelgusto.it/:Salone del Gusto]] towards the end of October and the [[http://www.golosaria.it/:Golosaria]] towards the end of November.

There is also a very special food complex named [[http://www.eataly.it/:Eataly]] in the Lingotto district - which is in the southern part of the city. It is a top quality foodstore plus numerous informal eating places and a top class restaurant.

[Ristorante del Cambio] (Piazza Carignano 2) Tel 011.546690/543760 $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:10]]) This is adjacent to Teatro Carignano, just South of Piazza Castello and one street West of Via Roma. You enter into a reception cum bar, deposit your coat in a cloakroom and proceed to a grand but cosy period room that majors in chandeliers. The waiters are formally dressed and the service is impeccable. The food is sophisticated Piemontese, and is excellent. You can drink very good wines by the glass, and the waiter will help you choose. Fairly expensive, but hard to fault. $$

[Trattoria Porto di Savona] (Piazza Vittorio Veneto 2) Tel 011.817-3500 $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:5]]) This is quite a nice place to sit outside in the piazza and eat, providing you don't mind beating off the pigeons! You can also eat inside in an atmosphere of a previous era. Reasonably priced. $$

[Self-Service 'Family'] (Via Bogino 2) Tel 011.883909 Open working weekdays 11:45 - 14:30 $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:2]]) This is off Via Po, 100 metres on the right coming from Piazza Castello. You go down some steps into a single very large room with vaulted ceilings and a long counter on your right. The food is good considering it is self-service, and it is astonishingly cheap! $$
