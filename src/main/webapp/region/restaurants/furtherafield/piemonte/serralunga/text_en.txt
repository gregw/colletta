Serralunga is about 30 minutes from the Marene/Cherasco turn off from the A6. After exiting the A6 toll you will find yourself on the A33 motorway. Come off at the first exit and follow the SP662, going straight across a roundabout beneath a flyover and follow the signs for Bra and then Alba on the SS231/E74. Just before coming into the centre of Alba turn right on to the tangenziale going south towards Grinzane Cavour and Barolo on the SP3(bis). Not far past Grinzane turn left following the signs for Serralunga d'Alba. You will pass the famous Fontana Fredda wine estates on the way up. $$

([[/region/restaurants/reviews:8]]) Coming from the direction of Alba, this is on the right just before you come into Serralunga. There are two nice rooms inside, but there is also a shaded terrace outside looking down over the vineyards, with a magnificent view of Castiglione Faletto perched on a hilltop opposite and La Morra behind it. Most of the dishes are based on local ingredients, and nearly everything is home prepared - they even make their own wine vinegar (from Barolo!). The service is very friendly and accommodating, and the food is both simple and sophisticated at one and the same time. This really is a fantastic place for a leisurely lunch on a fine day! Highly recommended. <tooc, May 2007> $$
