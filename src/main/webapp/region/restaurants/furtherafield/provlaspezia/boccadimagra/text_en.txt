You reach this via the autostrada exit at Sarzana (just past La Spezia), two hours from Colletta on a good day. Initially, head for Ameglia. If the roads are clear you'll be in Bocca in about 20 minutes. Then, of course, you'll have to park! It's a paradise for boating, but there hasn't been much in the way of modern development in the area.

([[/region/restaurants/reviews:6]]) This is near the end of the narrow road that runs along the West side of the mouth of the river Magra. There is very little in the way of civilsation here, and this large and excellent restaurant is quite a surprise to find! You can sit outside and admire the view across the water, or in the spacious and attractive wooden interior. In spite of its size, its popularity means that you are safer to book. The food is very enjoyable and is good value. $$
