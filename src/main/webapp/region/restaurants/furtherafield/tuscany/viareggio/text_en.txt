This is an upmarket seaside holiday town, with good shops and miles of well kept sandy beach (all with paid access, of course!). Forget culture if you come here, and just enjoy yourself! $$

However, if you are an opera fan you can go down to nearby Torre del Lago for the renowned open air summer season. $$

([[/region/restaurants/reviews:5]]) This is in the region across the river, at the South end of the lungomare, where most of what happens is concerned with boats. There are some parking spaces outside, or if you are on foot you can walk over the footbridge and turn towards the sea. You will find the restaurant facing the waterside and overlooking the beautiful boats and the marina. The position is good, the food is excellent, and the price is reasonable. <tooc, May 2006> $$

[Conca d'Oro] (Viale Marconi 91) Tel 0584.30757 $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:4]]) This is one of the many restaurants on the wide promenade along the top of the beach. It is a pleasant place to sit and watch the world go by, and the food is acceptable. However, like everywhere else on this stretch, it is overpriced. <tooc, April 2007> $$

[[http://www.romanoristorante.it/:Romano]] (Via Mazzini Giuseppe 122) Tel 0584.31382 $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:9]]) This is in one of the streets running up into the centre of town from the lungomare. It is of the most slick and stylish restaurants in the region, and you are expected to be smart (although not necessarily formal). The food is refined, very good and - of course - expensive! <tooc, Aug 2002> $$
