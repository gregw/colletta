This small town is just off one of the branches of the A11 (the Raccordo, running from Viareggio to Lucca and Florence/Firenze). It is at the north end of the lake (Lago di Massaciuccoli), at the south end of which is Torre del Lago Puccini where the summer opera seasons are held.

There are a few interesting restaurants here overlooking the lake.

[La Chandelle] (Via Casa Rossa) Tel 0584-938290 $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:7]]) Exit the A11 at Massarosa and follow the road down the hill. At the T-junction turn left, go round the one-way system past the hospital and continue. After a few hundred metres and just past the sign for Bozzano you will see the sign for La Chandelle on the left. Go up the narrow road to the restaurant. It is on the side of a hill surrounded by gardens and overlooking the lake. There is a separate terrace where in fine weather you can take a drink before your meal. Inside the main building you can sit in a conservatory with a view of the lake, or in summer you can sit in a detached conservatory. Both fish and meat dishes are served, and the food is good. $$
