This is a magnificent and historic hilltop town in the area of production of the famous vino nobile di Montepulciano. It has classy shops and restaurants and is not far off the A1 autostrada running from Firenze to Rome. $$

([[/region/restaurants/reviews:9]]) This is in a quiet street off the lower end of the corso – near the statue of Pulcinella (Punch). There are three large brick-built caverns inside, beautifully decorated and lit. The menu is a bit different to the standard offerings in the other restaurants, and includes gluten-free options. The food is of a very high standard. Recommended. <tooc, April 2007> $$

[Caffé Poliziano] (via di Voltaia nel Corso 27) Tel 0578-758615 $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:8]]) This a bar/pasticceria upstairs, and claims to be always open! It is very grand in a traditional style, and is a very popular venue. Downstairs there a good restaurant. <tooc, April 2007> $$
