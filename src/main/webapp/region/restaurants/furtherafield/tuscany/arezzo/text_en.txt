This is a large town with a very beautiful and atmospheric old centre (centro storico). Running up to the top of the hill - where the most beautiful buildings and piazzas are to be found - is Corso Italia, and this is where you will find the nice shops and bars and where the early evening passeggiata takes place. The view from the pinnacle of the hill is unmissable! $$

Every first Sunday of the month and the day before there is a large antiques market in the stupendous Piazza Grande (very near the top of the hill). $$

([[/region/restaurants/reviews:9]]) This is beautifully maintained in the style of a bygone era, and many of the diners appear to date from that period too! The service is quite formal and the food is sophisticated and very good. <tooc, April 2007> $$
