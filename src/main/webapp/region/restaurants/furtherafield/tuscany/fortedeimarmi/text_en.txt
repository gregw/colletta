This is a beautiful, clean and orderly town with wide streets, upmarket shops, thriving nightlife and a mile of immaculately maintained sandy beaches where you can relax under four-poster sun canopies and be served champagne by waiters in white waistcoats and bow ties. You can eat in excellent style at one of the many top notch restaurants associated with the beach establishments. In town there are good restaurants, among which is the very famous, very stylish and very pricey Lorenzo  (Via Carducci 61 Tel 0584-84030). $$
