There are many good restaurants within the walls of the centro storico, but there are also some very interesting ones in the surrounding hills and in villages slightly further afield.

Parking is a problem within the walls, where most of the slots are marked yellow and are for residents only. There are some blue bays, however, where you can pay to park. Be careful where you drive because most of the streets are pedestrian only (area pedonale) except for resident drivers.

([[/region/restaurants/reviews:8]]) This is next to [[http://www.universolucca.com:Hotel Universo]] in a side square off Piazza Napoleone, the main square in the town where events and concerts are sometimes held and the area where the antique markets set up their stalls. You can eat inside or outside in the square, where in cold weather you will be protected within a heated tent structure. The food is regional, of good quality and is well prepared and enjoyable. Both meat and fish dishes are served. <tooc, Feb 2006> $$

There are a couple of restaurants in the hills around Pieve Santo Stefano, North West of Lucca. From the road around the outside of the walls, follow the signs to Camaiore. Not far outside town you will cross the bridge over the river Serchio and turn left towards Sant' Alessio. After about a kilometre the main road curves right, after which you should go straight ahead (following the small blue sign for Pieve Santo Stefano) rather than following the main road as it curves left. If you miss this there will be another sign at Via Piana further along the main road. Either way, follow the brown signs for Tenuta di Forci as you go way up into the hills. After about 4 kilometres you will see Il Vipore on your left, with a gravel parking area just beyond it. A few hundred metres further on the left is Ristorante Lombardo (Tel 0583-394268/349091). $$

([[/region/restaurants/reviews:6]]) This is a well kept, country style ristorante with nice internal rooms and a very pleasant verandah at the back where you will want to dine in hot weather. The view of the valley is largely obscured by surrounding vegetation, but you can have a little wander into the back garden (a large field!) to admire the breathtaking view. The food is local style, rustic and wholesome, and the menu has English translations so you will know that if you order 'picchiante' you will be getting lamb's liver and lungs! The zuppa di farro (spelt soup) and the rosticciana (pork spare ribs) are good, and so is the rabbit. Everyone orders the chips, and so should you! This is an interesting place to visit, and is a nice escape for a lazy lunch at the weekend. <tooc, May 2006> $$
