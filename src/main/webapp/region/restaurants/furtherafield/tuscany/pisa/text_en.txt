At the airport, on the first level, there's a decent self-service restaurant and a good ristorante tucked away in a corner adjacent to it (Sala Mascagni, 050.43550).

There are many tourist restaurants in the vicinity of the Piazza del Duomo where the leaning tower is to be found. There are others worth investigating in the zone to the South of this between Via Roma and Borgo Stretto - the main shopping street North of the river.

There is also a very fine restaurant (Foresta) on the coast at Marina di Pisa.

!Marina di Pisa

[Foresta] (Via Litoranea 2) Tel 050-35082 $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:9]]) This is on the sea side of the lungomare just as you leave Marina di Pisa heading South towards Tirrenia. There is a large car park 50 metres along on the other side of the road. It is a top notch restaurant, serving dishes that are both creative and satisfying. It is worth starving in preparation for a visit here, because you really don't want to miss any of the courses! The service is confident to the extent that they don't even bother to go through the tiresome ritual of waiting for you to taste and approve the wine. They know they are good, and indeed they are. Exceptionally good, actually - and not over expensive!
