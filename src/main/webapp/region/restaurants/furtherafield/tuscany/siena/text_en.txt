This is a small but beautiful historic town plagued by large groups of day-trip tourists. Many of the restaurants on the beaten track seem to have given up any pride in what they serve.

[Ristorante Enzo] (Via Camollia 49) Tel 0577-281277 $$
This is off the beaten track a few hundred metres North of Piazza del Campo, in a continuation of Via Banchi di Sopra, the main shopping street. The proprietors will welcome you and offer you their carefully prepared creations, which are interpretations around a Tuscan theme. The quality is high, with a price to match. <tooc, May 2006> $$
