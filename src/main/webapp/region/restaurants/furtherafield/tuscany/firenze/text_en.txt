Driving into the centre is a nightmare of one way streets and restricted zones enforced with cameras. However, you are allowed in when arriving at or leaving your hotel, but you must ask reception to phone up and clear your registration number. $$

By day the town is flooded by large groups of tourists following their guides, and English seems to be the predominant language, albeit in various accents. In the evening things calm down and it is possible to relax and bask in the history, listen to the street music, and admire the elegant locals who now emerge and the elegant shops they appear to have visited! $$

As far as restaurants go, you must avoid the tourist traps which charge excessively for very poor food. $$

([[/region/restaurants/reviews:2]]) There is nothing to entice you in to this osteria as you pass it by, and on peering in you might easily decide to give it a miss. Don't! The food here is unadulterated and hearty, as grandma would have prepared it, and a more enjoyable and tasty meal would be hard to find. Try their own salami, the ribollita (thick soup) and the arista (roast rack of pork) - fabulous! The tables are long benches at which you will sit elbow to elbow with other diners, making the occasion an unforgettable experience. Not cheap, but worth every penny (Euros, actually - and no credit cards!). <tooc, May 2006> $$
