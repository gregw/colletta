This is a seaside town with a typical Ligurian centro storico augmented by some newer buildings at the eastern end. There is a large enclosed central piazza, through which there are arches to the lungomare and in which markets are sometimes held.

[A Ciappa] (Via Nunzio Cesare Regina) Tel 019-624231 $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:4]]) This is a small, friendly restaurant serving meat and fish prepared plainly - but well. <tooc, April 2004> $$

[Osteria da Veggia Pria] (Via U.Foscolo) Tel 019-627712 $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:2]]) This is very homely, and is quite an experience. The food is basic but perfectly OK. It is very popular with manual workers at lunchtime. Unexpectedly expensive for this kind of place. <tooc, April 2004> $$

[Da Max] (Via Don G. Bado, 45) Tel 019-626448 $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:3]]) This is on the lungomare at the near end of town, on the opposite side of the road to the beach.

[Fiorentina] (Piazza Martiri della Libertá 20) Tel 019-628244 $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:3]]) This is in a piazza that you reach through one of the arches leading off the lungomare. There are tables outside under an awning and in a room inside. The service is indifferent and the food likewise. Avoid! <tooc, October 2007> $$

[[http://www.lasvolta2.com/:La Svolta 2]] (via della Libertà 6) Tel 019-612594 $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:5]]) This is a tiny restaurant hidden away in a street behind the main piazza. The narrow room is nicely painted with a street scene one side and a sea view the other, and this together with the very warm and genuine welcome from the Neapolitan patron puts you immediately at ease and makes for an enjoyable experience. <tooc, December 2008> $$

[Buca di Bacco] (Corso Italia 113) Tel 019.615.307 $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:8]]) This is on the north side of the aurelia road just outside Pietra Ligure to the east. There is parking outside in a courtyard, but you need to ask them to open the entry barrier. The food is mainly fish-based, and there is a selection of good wines to go with it. There is not an extensive menu but the standard is high. <tooc, December 2009> $$

[[http://www.ristoranteilcapanno.com/:Il Capanno]] (Via Cappelletta 63, loc Ranzi) Tel 019 625198 $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:7]]) This is high up in the hills above Pietra Ligure. Coming off the autostrada you immediately take a left and ascend towards Ranzi. Follow the road up and up and you will eventually find the restaurant on a corner on the left. It is a large venue, divided into a number of beautiful rooms of varying sizes. The core room has the feel of a mountain cabin, with a fireplace and a stupendous view from the window – in this case of the bay and the island of Gallinara in the distance. There is a good range of meat dishes on the menu along with the expected range of fish and other local specialities. They are serious about their food here, and you will eat and drink well. <tooc, January 2009> $$

[Olivier's Pub] - enoteca, bar, tabacchi, lotto (via Garibaldi 69 / corso Roma 128) Tel 019-668134/670266 $$
This is a tabacconist’s at the Via Garibaldi entrance, but a bar cum wine bar at the entrance from the lungomare! There is a fine selection of wines to try and buy, and some nice wooden tables and benches to sit at. <tooc, December 2008> $$
