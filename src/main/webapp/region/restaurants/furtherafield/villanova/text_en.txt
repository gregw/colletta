Go to the roundabout at UniEuro and take the first exit (right), going along the bypass road (Aurelia bis) towards Alassio. Take the first exit (Pieve di Teco, Ortovero) and turn left at the T-junction. There will be a turn off on the left signposted for Villanova, and this will lead you across the river to this picturesque village, which you will see on your right. $$

[Osteria di Si] (Vico Ponte 9) Tel 0182-585006 $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:5]]) This is a small osteria with a small but constantly changing menu. Hence all the food is freshly prepared, and correspondingly all the more enjoyable. <tooc, Sept 2008> $$

[Le 10 Torri] (via Roma 17) Tel 0182-582697 $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:4]]) This ristorante/pizzeria is in a little square next to the post office, a stone's throw from Enzo the butcher's, where they get their meat. No surprise, then, that the sottofilletto and the costata are very good! Fresh fish is also served and the house wine is good. <tooc, March 2009> $$

[Claro de Luna] (Via Bossoleto) Tel 0182-580553 $$
This is beyond Villanova d'Albenga not far along the road that eventually takes you over the hills and steeply down into Alassio. Going towards Garlenda, just after the [[/activities/horseracing/:ippodromo]], take the first left (SP55, signposted to Bossoleto). Just before you reach the flyover you will see the restaurant down on your left. There is an interesting rustic garden with a lean-to in which you eat in summer ([[/region/restaurants/reviews:3]]), and a very beautiful room inside for the winter ([[/region/restaurants/reviews:6]]). The food is good. There are some meat and fish dishes - and sometimes snails - but most people come for the pizza and foccacia. <tooc, July 2005> $$

[[http://www.campingceraunavolta.it/:C'Era Una Volta]] (Strada per Ligo, Regione Fascetti] Tel 0182-580461 $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:2]]) This is the restaurant/pizzeria serving a camp site a little way outside the centre. You need to get to the other side of the airport or the [[/activities/horseracing/:ippodromo]] and go up the hill on the road towards Ligo. The food is very ordinary, but this is an excellent place to take hyperactive kids, who can clamber about freely on a small train parked right next to a terrace of tables outside the restaurant. <tooc, August 2006> $$
