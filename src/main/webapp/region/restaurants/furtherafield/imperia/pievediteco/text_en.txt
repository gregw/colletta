This small but grand old town is about a 45 minute drive from Colletta via Cisano sul Neva and Ortovero. It has one main street (Corso Ponzoni), with a long portico on either side. There is nothing much at all in the way of shops or restaurants, but there is an antiques market on the last Sunday of every month. $$

([[/region/restaurants/reviews:4]]) This is the main street, and you can sit outside under the portico or in the pleasant rooms inside. There is a set menu of Ligurian dishes, with a few choices. The food is very enjoyable and is excellent value. $$
