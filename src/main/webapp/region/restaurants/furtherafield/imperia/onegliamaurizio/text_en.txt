There are two areas here where the restaurants are concentrated - the fishing port of Oneglia and the tourist port of Porto Maurizio.

!Oneglia

This the eastern side of Imperia, accessible directly from the motorway (Imperia Est) - head towards the sea. A number of the restaurants are in the block between the coast road that heads one-way towards the east (Via Andrea Doria), and the harbour front. Parking is a problem, and there seems always to be a traffic jam! However, once you are there it is a nice setting.

[Chez Braccioforte] (Via des Geneys 48, Calato Cuneo 33) Tel 0183-294752 $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:9]]) This a very fine and sophisticated fish restaurant with a beautiful classic style interior. The restaurant has been run by the family members for over one hundred and fifty years, and the experience shows!. Not cheap, but it can't be bettered. <tooc, August 2008> $$ 

[AgroDolce] (Calata Cuneo, 25) Tel 0183-293702 $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:9]]) This is an elegant restaurant serving very fine food, including both meat and fish. The staff are welcoming, helpful and knowledgeable. However, you'll need a bit of Italian to communicate and to understand the menu. There are some tables outside under the portico and also in the open area beyond. <tooc, April 2006> $$ 

[Salefino] (Calata Cuneo 41) Tel 0183-291719 $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:5]]) This is a good fish restaurant, mid-range in style. There are some tables outside under the portico and also in the open area beyond. <tooc, October 2007> $$

[San Lorenzo] (Calata Cuneo) $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:5]]) This is an attractive minimalist-looking restaurant run by twenty-somethings who look trendy but don't seem to know anything about good food or wine. <tooc, May 2005>$$

[Salvo Ristorante Cacciatori] (Via Vieusseux, 12) Tel 0183 293763 $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:8]]) This is near Piazza Dante, in a pedestrian street off Via Bonfante (the one with 
the portici and the shops). It is an attractive restaurant with good service and good food. There are both fish and meat dishes on the menu. <tooc, April 2006> $$

!Porto Maurizio

This is the very dramatic looking town you see spread across a hill down to the sea and the port.  It is on the West side of Imperia, accessible most directly from the Imperia Ovest motorway exit. As you arrive at the sea front, there are a number of restaurants in the small roads on either side at the top of the beach (Lungomare Colombo).

There are also some restaurants on the sea front by the port and in the streets just behind. This area is generally known as 'Borgo marina'. You can get there by a half a kilometre walk around the cliff towards the East, or by joining the semi-permanent traffic queue going up the hill to the East and taking a fork down again to the right. Grab the first parking space that you see! $$

[Hostaria] (Piazza S.Antonio, Borgo marina) Tel 0183-667028 $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:5]]) This is in a large attractive room with a high arched brick ceiling. The menu is fairly standard for the region, with plenty of fish, but there is some meat - and it is good! The fricassea di carciofi is nice as a starter. <tooc, April 2006> $$

[Capitan Blood] (Lungomare C.Colombo 186) Tel 0183.61070 $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:6]]) This is the most distinguished of the ristoranti along this quaint stretch of road alongside the beach. It's at the far end, and there is a car parking area just beyond. You can sit outside and admire the beautiful views of Porto Maurizio and the sea while eating and drinking well at the same time! <tooc, April 2006> $$
