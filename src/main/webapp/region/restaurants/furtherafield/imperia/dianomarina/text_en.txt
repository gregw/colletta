This is a relatively modern seaside town with a tourist harbour, made famous by the novels of Annie Hawes (Extra Virgin, Ripe for the Picking, and Journey to the South). There are a couple of shop-lined streets that are closed off to traffic for much of the day and the atmosphere is relaxed and congenial.

There is a secondary area named Sant'Anna at the west end of the town.

The easiest way to get to the restaurants in this area is to head out of town on the aurelia coastal road going west, and as you get to the end of the bridge over the railway line at the end of the bay you turn right into Via Agnese Francesco. 

[Sole Mio] (Via Francesco Agnese 38) Tel 0183-493087 $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:5]]) This is a brasserie and pizzeria with a large capacity both inside and out. In appearance the place is quite showy and has a southern Italian feel. The menu is very straightforward â€“ the options being basically pizza, pasta and grilled meat and fish. <tooc, Aug 2008> $$

([[/region/restaurants/reviews:6]]) This restaurant has an adjacent car park for customers, just on the north side of the railway line. There is a garden where you can dine, as well as ample space inside. The food is all prepared in-house (including home-made pasta) and the patron is anxious to please. <tooc, Aug 2008> $$
