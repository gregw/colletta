This large, busy and rather seedy town is on the border with France, and attracts many French day trippers who come to avail themselves of the cheaper prices. There is, however, a large and interesting market for fruit and vegetables, and a weekly market renowned for counterfeit fashion items (that it is now illegal to purchase, and inadvisable to try to take over the border!). $$

The best area for restaurants is across the river to the West of the main town - on the waterfront, in the picturesque old town above, or further along the SP1 coastal road to just before the border post, where there are a couple of restaurants down near the beach. If you do head towards the border, be sure to take the left fork for Mentone just as you pass out of Latte. $$

[La Capannina] (Passeggiata Marconi 13) Tel 0184-357155 $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:5]]) Go over the bridge to the old town, through the tunnel (Marina S.Giuseppe), and turn right at the end. The restaurant is one of a number at the top of the beach, but is known by the locals as the best of the bunch. An unusual ricotta dish is served immediately for you to try while deciding what to eat. The fish is excellent, and everything seems to be prepared with loving attention. Whether or not you normally have a dessert, you simply must try the souffl√© alle mandorle! Recommended. <tooc, July 2006> $$

[S.Giuseppe] (Piazza Marconi, Marina S.Giuseppe) Tel 0184-34169 $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:4]])  Go over the bridge to the old town, through the tunnel (Marina S.Giuseppe), and turn left at the end. The restaurant is at the top of the beach - with tables inside, in an outer covered area and on an open sunny terrace. It is in a very nice position overlooking the bay, and with an ample parking area in the piazza outside. The food, however, is nothing special and does not justify the elevated price. <tooc, November 2008> $$

[Balzi Rossi] (Via Balzi Rossi 2, Frontiera San Ludovico) Tel 0184-38132 $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:9]]) Just in front of the border post into France, turn off towards the sea, where there is a convenient car park just in front of the restaurant. It is in a very nice position below the cliffs and on the rocks on the seafront overlooking Menton across the bay. It is very well adorned inside, in a rather formal and somewhat dated style, and the staff are professional and dressed for the job - but friendly nonetheless. The food is very good - carefully prepared with high quality ingredients - and by the time you receive your bill you will have sensed the need to brace yourself! <tooc, November 2007> $$
