Traffic permitting, it takes about 45 minutes to get here via the autostrada. Exit at Arma di Taggia and go West either along the Aurelia SS1 coastal road or, for speed, via the SS1 bis through a series of tunnels which bring you out further along the coast. The town itself is normally jammed with traffic - intolerably so at peak times! There is parking around the now defunct railway station, just down by the sea from the grand Casino, and in various other spots around the town. Good luck!

[L'Airone] (Piazza Eroi Sanremesi 12) Tel 0184.531469 $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:4]]) This is in a central position, but tucked away in the narrow shopping streets of the old town in a small square where they sell flowers and plants, just back from Corso Matteotti. It is a popular and bustling neighbourhood eating place, serving good food without any pretensions and at a reasonable price. The fritelle di bianchetti (small omelettes with whitebait) are excellent! <tooc, December 2004> $$

[[http://www.operamage.com:Opera Ma-Ge]] (Via Cavour 21) Tel 0184.574235 $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:4]]) This is in a side street alongside the Archaelogical Museum that runs up the hill from Corso Matteotti to Via Palazzo in the old town. It is actually a take-away outlet selling pizza, focaccia, torta verde, etc., but there are a couple of bar-style seats that you can sit at (if you are lucky!). The food is very good. As a matter of fact, the torta verde in Sanremo is generally more succulent than elsewhere and often contains courgettes or leeks as well as spinach. <tooc, August 2005> $$

[[http://www.lavoltabuona.it/:La Volta Buona]] (Piazza Bresca) Tel 0184-501903 $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:4]]) This is in an area just across the road from the tourist port where there is a concentration of restaurants and bars. You can eat in a small cavern inside or under a shaded pergola in the piazza outside. The food is typical local fare prepared in the traditional manner. Honest and enjoyable! <tooc, September 2007> $$
