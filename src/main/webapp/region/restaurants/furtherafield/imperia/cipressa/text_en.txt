This is a very well-kept old borgo with a spacious main piazza high up and overlooking the sea. You reach it from the aurelia road either at San Lorenzo al Mare, west of Imperia, or from Santo Stefano al Mare, a bit further along towards San Remo. $$

([[/region/restaurants/reviews:4]]) This is in the western corner of the main piazza. You enter a smart reception room and proceed up the stairs ahead into the main dining room, at the end of which you can access another room overlooking the piazza. There is a degustazione mini or maxi menu that provides a number of antipasti, primi and secondi - good value, but you had better be hungry if you go for the maxi! The food is good quality home-cooking style, and the service is friendly. <tooc, March 2007> $$
