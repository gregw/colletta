This is a small seaside town just this side of Sanremo with upmarket shops and restaurants.

([[/region/restaurants/reviews:8]]) This is at the top of the beach at pavement level in the focal point of the town. There are equally attractive tables inside and out. The food is excellent, and I have to give a special recommendation for the raw fish. A top spot on all criteria. <tooc, July 20011> $$
