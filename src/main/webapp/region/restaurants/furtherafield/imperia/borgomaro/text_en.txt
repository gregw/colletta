[Censin da Bea] (Via A Guglieri) Tel 335-8212982 $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:3]]) This is just off the SS28 between Oneglia and Pieve di Teco. Head for Borgomaro, and it is on your left just as you reach the outskirts of the village. It is very rustic and primitive, and really quite remarkable! There are rooms on two levels, and a couple of outside areas overlooking the stream at the back – which is swarming with fish. At the side there is a rotating water mill. You will be served an enormous amount of food, including numerous antipasti amongst which there will be frogs fried in breadcrumbs and marinaded trout. Then there will be two pasta dishes, and then three secondi – probably stoccafisso (a dryish fish and potato stew), lumache (snails, in a casserole) and tagliata di manzo (slices of beef). You cannot possibly eat everything that is brought to your table (even though you will be urged to do so!), so just save yourself for the things that you like best. At the end you will be offered desert followed by various liqueurs and tasty accompaniments. As you can imagine, it will not be a quick meal, but the bonus is that it will be unexpectedly cheap! It is usually only open in the evenings, but you will find it open for lunch if enough people have booked. $$
