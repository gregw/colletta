The village of [[http://www.bioliguria.it/:Bajardo (or Baiardo)]] is up in the hills at 900 metres, just under 30 km from Sanremo. You can get to it by following the SP55 from the Aurelia SS1 on the East side of Sanremo.

[Ristorante Pizzeria Jolanda] (Via Roma 47) Tel 0184.673017 $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:3]]) This is a popular restaurant, on the left as you ascend into the centre of the village along the main street. There are some tables outside and some old cartwheels giving a rustic impression. The room inside is indeed rustic, with an old stove in the middle and a pizza oven and kitchen area in one corner. You are served a fixed menu of wholesome and enjoyable local dishes that (untypically) are not particularly salty. Similarly, the desert of apple fritters is (untypically) not particularly sweet! No matter what time you arrive, there seems to be an equalising process such that everyone ends up getting their desert at the same time! $$
