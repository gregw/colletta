This is a beautiful little village that has become a community of artists. Over the Easter weekend there is a festival where the residents compete to create flower arrangements to mimic accompanying paintings. They have declared themselves an independent principality!

[Il Principe] (Piazza Martini Patrioti) Tel 0184-223570 $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:4]]) This is in the piazza used for parking at the far end of town. There is a bar area, a large dining room and a conservatory at the back with a nice view over the valley. The food is very good, and the seafood pasta is excellent. $$
