Cervo is a picturesque village on a hill by the sea between San Bartolomeo al Mare and Marina di Andora. It is well visited by tourists, and there are a number of good restaurants here. There are a couple of small car parks near the top of the village, and another one just beyond it, all accessible from the Aurelia road at the west side of the village, and a tiny car park accessible via a fork off the Aurelia road on the east side of the village. $$

[Serafino] (Via Matteotti) Tel 0183-408185 $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:5]]) This bar/restaurant has a great view over the bay, and this makes it a popular venue for a drink, snack or a meal. The food is good, and on a fine day this is an excellent place to be! You'll find it about half way down the hill, below and west of the church. <tooc, July 2004>$$

[San Giorgio] (Via A.Volta 19) Tel 0183-400175 $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:9]]) This is at the top of the village just inside the walls. It has a number of absolutely stunning dining rooms, and a couple of lovely balconies (one large, one small) on which you can dine overlooking the side of the hill and the coast to the west. If you want to dine in elegant style, then come here. If you want top quality food, then perhaps not. And if you want friendly service, then definitely not! <tooc, August 2006> $$

[[http://www.porteghetto.com/:Il Porteghetto]] (via Aurelia 9) Tel 0183-400047 $$
This is on the sea side of the Aurelia road just to the east of Cervo, above a small beach and some rocks and stone breakwaters. It is in an excellent position, but the downside is the difficulty in finding a parking spot! In May they have a programme of jazz evenings.$$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:6]]) On the top two levels there is a bar and open-air terrace, but it is quite stylish for such an establishment and serves excellent quality simple meals and snacks.  It is quite expensive, but you are paying for the quality and the spectacular view over the bay and Cervo itself. $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:9]]) On the lowest level there is a very elegant restaurant with the rock face forming the inner wall and sheet glass panels separating you from the sea while providing a spectacular view over the bay. The menu changes regularly, following the produce of the season, and provides a fusion of tradition and creativity. English is spoken. <tooc, January 2008> $$
