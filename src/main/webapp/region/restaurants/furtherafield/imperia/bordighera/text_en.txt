Bordighera is an upmarket town split between the coastal strip, where the shops are to be found, and the old town up on the hill - which you pass on route to or from the motorway.

[[http://www.hotelparigi.com/lareserve:La Reserve]] (Via Arziglia 20) Tel 0184-261322 $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:8]]) This is on the sea side of the Aurelia road (SS1), just on the east flank of Bordighera and right next to the tourist port. It is in a very nice location overlooking the sea, and above the Hotel Parigi private beach. The menu has some unusual touches, all of which work very well indeed, and you will have a very interesting, relaxing and enjoyable meal here. It is not overly expensive for such a high quality restaurant in such an excellent location. Naturally enough, it is very popular and you should book to be sure of getting a table - even at lunchtime. <tooc, May 2006> $$

[Alcione] (lungomare argentina 24) Tel 0184-261839 $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:7]]) This is on the town side of the lungomare about 500 metres east of the railway station. You can get there via a number of subways that take you under the railway line (on foot) and up onto the walkway at the top of the beach. There are tables outside and a very smart room inside with windows overlooking the sea. The food is sophisticated and the desserts, all home made, are stupendous. The proprieter, Roberto, speaks good English. Recommended. <tooc, November 2008> $$
