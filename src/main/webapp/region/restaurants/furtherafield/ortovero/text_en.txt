Ortovero is a village on the main road (SP453) that you take to get to Pieve di Teco. It is about 10 minutes from the roundabout at UniEuro. Head along the Aurelia bis bypass, come off at the first exit and follow the signs. You will pass the North flank of the airfield on your left. $$

([[/region/restaurants/reviews:9]]) This is in a small, very smart white building, slightly set back from the road on the left as you approach Ortovero.
Andrea, the proprietor, used to run the excellent Mezzo restaurant on the sea front near the pier in Alassio and continues to excel here. Top quality ingredients (including fish) prepared with respect. Highly recommended. <tooc, Dec 2010> $$
