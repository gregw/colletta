Worlds away from the busy Aurelia road that runs behind it, the picturesque old town stretches for about a kilometre along the lungomare. It is lined with shops, bars and restaurants. At the far end there is a harbour for small to medium sized tourist boats. $$

[Il Caciucco] (via Pirandello 13) Tel 019-673707 / 339-8772825 (closed Tuesdays) $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:4]]) This is tucked away in the residential streets north of the aurelia road, and it wouldn't catch the attention. However, the atmosphere is very welcoming, the food is good and it is packed with locals 'in the know'. <tooc, August 2009> $$

[Matama] (Via Ghilini A. 26 - at the near end of the 'budello') Tel 019-677459 $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:7]]) There are some tables outside in the wide pedestrianised shopping street and others inside in a charming and spacious bricked cavern. Very good food and caring service. <tooc, April 2003> $$

[Bagatto] (Via Ricciardi, in the centro storico) Tel 019-675844 $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:6]]) This is a fish restaurant that takes itself seriously, perhaps a little more so than it merits. Nonetheless, the food is good enough – let down, perhaps, only by over inflated expectations!  <tooc, July 2004> $$

[Sirena] (Lungomare Garassini Garbarini) Tel 019-668294 $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:3]]) This is a large building at the top of the beach Bagni Sirena. The place looks a little bit neglected, as does the appearance of the staff, but the food is straightforward and perfectly OK!  <tooc, April 2006> $$

[La Buona Luna] (Via Stella 2) Tel 019-675178 $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:4]]) This on the corner of a small piazza about midway down the lungomare. The standard range of dishes is on offer at a reasonable price with quality to match. They don't take bookings.  <tooc, July 2005> $$

[[http://www.pizzeriadarino.com\:Pizzeria Da Rino]] (Corso Europea 413) Tel 019-670758/019-671278 $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:4]]) This is solely a pizza restaurant, but it is now run in tandem with La Buona Luna next door, so you can sit in either restaurant and be served from either menu! <tooc, Sept 2008> $$

[La Piazzetta] (Piazza Vittorio Veneto) Tel 019-675819 $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:6]]) The proprietor here does nothing to make his diners feel welcome, and appears to have an initial contempt for tourists. However, if you can convince him that you are a serious diner you will eat well here. It's in a nice little piazza, and in warm weather you can sit at tables outside in the square. The spaghetti alla pescatore is excellent, and the fish in general is very good.  <tooc, August 2006> $$

[U Pelandrun] (Via Boragine, 24 - near the far end of the 'budello') Tel 019-677395 $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:7]]) This is an elegant and popular restaurant that serves well presented dishes. There are some tables outside in a courtyard at the back which is open in warm weather.  <tooc, May 2005> $$

[Vittorino Enoteca] (Corso Roma, 62 – on the lungomare, on the opposite side between Bagni Sirena and Albergo Perelli) Tel 019-674378 $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:5]]) A smart place to sit outside and have a drink. There's a good wine list, and they serve a very nice (but expensive) glass of champagne. However, the service can sometimes be a bit offhand. They also offer food in the small room inside, although I wouldn't recommend it.  <tooc, April 2006> $$

[SamSara] (Via Ricciardi, 20 - in the back streets of the centro storico) Tel 347-2459529 $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:3]]) This is a bar that also sells its own produce in jars, much of which is organic (garlic, tomatoes, peppers, honey, etc). They have a wide variety of herbal teas, in addition to all the usual things. <tooc, May 2005> $$

[Gelateria Il Melograno] (via Garibaldi 4) Tel 019-666883 $$
This is in the 'budello' just near the old walls and the clock. It is a small take-away counter, but the gelati are the most natural tasting you will find for miles around! <tooc, September 2008> $$
