Go to the roundabout at UniEuro and take the first exit (right), going along the bypass road (Aurelia bis) towards Alassio. Take the second exit (Villanova & Garlenda) and turn left at the T-junction. The road leads past the golf course and through the village of Garlenda. $$

[Il Frantoio] (Via Lerrone, 56) Tel 0182-582046 $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:2]]) This is on a corner in front of you on the main road just before you get to the village. It is predominantly a pizzeria, although you can get the basic items that most restaurants serve. Cheap. No credit cards. <tooc, July 2005>$$

[Rosalina] (Via Roma, 76) Tel 0182-580064 $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:4]]) This is on the right at the far end of the village. It is a fairly rustic setting, and the food is plainly prepared and presented, but very good. The antipasto consists of cured meats and vegetables, some of which are preserved and some freshly prepared. For secondo there are both fish and meat dishes of the standard varieties for the region. The rabbit is excellent - very fleshy and not at all salty. No credit cards. <tooc, November 2006> $$

[Henry] (Borgata Chiappa 23, Via Roma) Tel 0182-582599 $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:7]]) This is down a slope beneath a large sign on the left beyond the far end of the village. You dine in a large and very beautiful rustic room. The accent here is on meat of various kinds - steaks, shins and lamb tagines for example. <tooc, July 2011> $$

[[http://www.relaischateaux.com/meridiana:Il Rosmarino]] (Via ai Castelli) Tel 0182-580271 $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:10]]) This is on the left as you approach Garlenda, just past the entrance to the golf club. It is the gastronomic restaurant at La Meridiana hotel, listed in the Relais and Chateaux guide, and the immaculate classic style of the interior and the professional and attentive service is just what you would expect. In summer you can sit on the garden terrace. The owner, Edmondo, and his assistant Franco both speak near perfect English and make you feel very welcome. A visit to this restaurant is worth every penny, but make sure you take quite a few! In summer, from 13:00 to 19:00, they serve a typically Ligurian style menu by the pool - and if you request it in advance you can eat from this menu in the evening as well. <tooc, July 2007> $$

[[http://www.garlendagolf.it/hotel_golf.htm:Foresteria Golf Club]] (Via del Golf, Via Lerrone) Tel 0182-583813 $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:8]]) This is in the golf club building accessed via a driveway on the right as you approach Garlenda, not far from the horse racing stadium. The general surroundings are very beautiful and the inside of the building is also very nice, although slightly jaded. You go into the hotel reception and up the stairs to the left. The food is unexpectedly simple for such an establishment, but it is good enough and the price is reasonable. <tooc, May 2005> $$
