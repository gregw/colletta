You get to this tiny village by going up the mountain road via Nasino and Alto. It takes about 30 minutes from Colletta.

([[/region/restaurants/reviews:3]]) There is one wide street/piazza in Caprauna, and the restaurant is on the side overlooking the valley. You go down some steps to the entrance, outside of which is an unkempt and off-putting seating area where there are very often a number of elder residents chatting, smoking and drinking. However, there is a homely room inside at the back where you dine. You will be offered the dishes of the locality, most of which will be home produced - their cheese and salumi, for example. The food is honest, flavoursome and served with pride. <tooc, July 2006>$$

About a kilometre before you get to the pass there is a signposted dirt road to the right leading to the rifugio. They serve the food gathered from the surrounding area, prepared simply.
It's a beautifully wild setting, and you can see Tuscany and Corsica on a clear day. They offer all the usual mountain activities (hiking, climbing, biking, canooing, .....) and you can stay there too. It is open all the time from June 1st to September 30th, and otherwise at weekends and on festive days - except for the annual closure in November. However, you can phone to make special arrangements.
