This is a little gem of a village at the end of a bay beyond Finale Ligure. What sets it apart is that private dwellings border the top of the beach, and in winter you can escape the commercialism of most other waterfronts. In summer, however, the beach establishments are there in force and the experience is different - but it's still worth a visit. $$

([[/region/restaurants/reviews:9]]) This is on the north side of the Aurelia a few hundred metres from the old village at the end of the bay. It is smart and modern inside, with a few tables outside on the verandah with a view of the bay. It is a fish restaurant of a high standard, and you can select your meal from the very fresh looking catch on display. The service is faultless, but perhaps a little too formal. $$
