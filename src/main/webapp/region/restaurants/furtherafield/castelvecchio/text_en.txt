[Da Eber e Anna] (via Maggiore 2, frazione Vecersio) Tel 0182-78238 / 335.6039289 $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:5]]) This is at the fringe of the little village of Vecersio (2km beyond Castelvecchio). For a casual meal you will eat at the rough tables in the bar area, but there is a nice room downstairs for more serious dining. The food is simple, wholesome and enjoyable and the price is reasonable. <tooc, Feb 2007>
