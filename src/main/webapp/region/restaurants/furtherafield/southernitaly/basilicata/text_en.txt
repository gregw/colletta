Basilicata has a short coastline on the Tyrrhenian sea and another on the Ionian sea, with National Park areas and many interesting towns inland. The Tyrrhenian coastline is very dramatic, with mountains plunging into the sea, whereas the Ionian side is much flatter. $$

[Maratea]

This town has a small centro storico about 1000ft above sea level and a small port below on the Tyrrhenian sea. Just to the north of the port is the very expensive [[http://www.mondomaratea.it:Santavenere hotel]] that attracts celebrities and gives Maratea its touch of glamour. However, the town itself does not have the stylish shops and fine restaurants that you would expect celebrities to frequent! $$

[La Taverna Rovita] (via Rovita 13) Tel 0973-876588 $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:6]]) This is in a narrow side street off the central Piazza Buraglia. It has two rustic, cosy and atmospheric rooms and a caff√©/pasticceria attached next door. The food is authentically regional but surprisingly expensive! <tooc, March 2007> $$

[Matera]

This inland capital city is famous for its 'sassi' - a bowl of caves cut into the tufo and used as dwellings up until recent times. $$

[La Cantina Della Bruna] (via Spartivento 20) Tel 0835.335010 / 329.9511755 $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:4]]) This is in the sassi, and consists of an upstairs terrace and caverns within cut into the tufo. It is very atmospheric, and the food and service is good. <tooc, August 2006> $$
