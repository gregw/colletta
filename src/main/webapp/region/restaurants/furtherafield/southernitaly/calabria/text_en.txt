On the Tyrrhenian sea (top of the toe) there are a number of well established coastal resorts, but the Ionian coast (underside of the toe) has been less developed until recently, when there has commenced a spate of new apartment block and town house construction projects.

!Tyrrhenian coast

[Tropea] $$

This is an old town and top resort, built dramatically on the cliffs with a sandy beach below, mountains behind, and a view over the Aeolian islands including Stromboli. Many of the restaurants are tourist traps, but there are some decent ones.

[Pimm's Restaurant] (Largo Migliarese) Tel 0963-666105 $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:8]]) This is on the cliff's edge, overlooking the island monastery. It is very atmospheric, the food is very good and the price is reasonable. <tooc, February 2007> $$

[La Cantina del Principe] (Largo Galluppi 19) Tel 0963-61400 $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:4]]) This is in a side street off Via Roma. You go down some steps into an interesting and cavernous cellar, where you sit at rustic wooden tables. The restaurant is family-run, and much of the produce is their own - and they take a pride in it. You eat well here, and at a very good price. <tooc, April 2007> $$

[Il Normanno] (via Pontorieri 13) Tel 0963-603240 $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:5]]) This at the end of Via Roma just beyond the duomo. There are tables at the front outside, but you can sit inside in a pleasant room - spoiled only by the presence of a TV (mercifully with the sound muted!). The food is good and the price is reasonable. <tooc, April 2007> $$

[Sant'Angelo] (loc Fazzari, Drapia) Tel 0963-67209 / 328-2722037 $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:5]]) This is up in the hills above Tropea, and is very popular with the locals. There is some basic seating outside, but there is a nice rustic room within. The food is of the local style and is wholesome and enjoyable. <tooc, April 2007> $$

[La Boheme] ((Largo Duomo, via Roma) Tel 0963-603053 $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:4]]) This is an ordinary restaurant serving the standard fare. There is a room inside and tables opposite in the atmospheric piazza for use in warm weather. <tooc, April 2007> $$

[Tropea Vecchia] (Largo Barone) Tel 0963-61899 $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:3]]) There are some tables outside in the rather claustrophobic piazza, and some more inside in a small room. The food is standard tourist fare, and the staff appear to be more interested in watching the television than in attending to their customers! <tooc, April 2007> $$

[Pizzo] $$

About a 20 minute drive north along the coast from Tropea, the old town is perched on the cliffs with a newer development above. There is also some development on the beach below, where there are some restaurants and bars. $$

[Forte della Monacella] (Lungomare C.Colombo) Tel 0963-531307 $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:5]]) This is situated in a dramatic position right beneath the cliff below the old town. There is a brick-built circular room, and another separate more ramshackle one with a nice view over the beach. The food is very good, and the price reasonable. <tooc, April 2007> $$

[Scilla] $$

This is on the coast just north of Reggio Calabria, far down in the South a stone's throw from Sicily. The picturesque old town is built on the cliffs jutting out into the sea. On the south side there is a sandy beach with hotels, bars and restaurants (Marina Grande), whereas to the north is the fisherman's village (Chianalea) built right on the water's edge - also with a hotel and restaurants. $$

[[http://www.hotelubais.it:Il Pirata]] (Chianalea, via Grotte 22) Tel 0965-704292/704200 $$
This is in a very distinctive setting by the water's edge, and is decked out very effectively like an old wooden ship! The restaurant is part of the hotel next door (Principe di Scilla) , and serves excellent food. <tooc, April 2007> $$

!Ionian coast

[Roccella Jonica] $$

This is a medium-size coastal town with basic shops and restaurants. On the hill above there is a lovely monastery that is slowly being restored.

[[http://www.lacascina1899.it:La Cascina Ristorante]] Tel 0964-866675 $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:8]]) This is on the coastal road a little way east of the landmark [[http://www.parcodeiprincipi-roccella.com/:Hotel Parco Dei Principi]] and a few kilometres west of the town. It is in a very beautiful old frantoio, and the food is sophisticated while remaining excellent value. <tooc, February 2007> $$

[Marina di Gioiosa] $$

This is a coastal strip with some decent shops, bars and restaurants.

[[http://www.gamberorosso.rc.it:Gambero Rosso]] (via Montezemolo 65) Tel 0964-415806 $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:10]]) This is at the western end of the town, on the south side of the main through road. It is a very fine restaurant, yet the staff are down to earth and very friendly and helpful. The food is sophisticated, but in no way over-elaborate, and is a miracle of conception and execution. The desserts are absolutely fantastic! At the end you will be offered a sample of the uncommercialised, rare but highly prized dessert wine named Greco di Bianco, poured from an unlabeled bottle! Well worth a detour. <tooc, February 2007> $$
