This is a town on the industrial coastline just to the west of Genoa airport - to which there is relatively quick access. There are numerous very grand buildings, but they are all sadly neglected and there is nothing that obviously merits a stop here as you pass through on the coastal road - although there is a strip of beach alongside a very large rock topped by a striking fortification ([[http://www.pegli.com/car_castelluccio.php:Castelluccio]]).

([[/region/restaurants/reviews:8]]) This is in a small square off the coastal road, near Castelluccio. Like much in Pegli, it doesn't look very attractive from the outside and a further discouragement is the chaotic double parking outside! However, join the crowd and abandon your car in the forgivable pursuit of an excellent meal. The interior is elegant, the service friendly and knowledgeable, and the food sophisticated. There are comfortable rooms upstairs on the first floor, which makes it an excellent choice for an overnight stop if you need to be at the airport early and unstressed. <tooc, October 2008> $$
