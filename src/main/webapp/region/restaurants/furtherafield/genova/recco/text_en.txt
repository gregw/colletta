This is a small town of no great beauty or interest just this side of the Portofino peninsula. The only reason to stop here is for the famous focaccia di Recco! Good places to try it are the local favourite [[http://www.daovittorio.it:Da O Vittorio]], or the very well-known Manuelina.

([[/region/restaurants/reviews:8]]) Coming off the motorway at Recco, you descend into the town and cross the river. Turn left and the restaurant is about 100 metres on your right. There are a number of well-tended rooms, classic in style with a slightly rustic feel. Everyone starts off with a plate (or two!) of foccacia di Recco (thin crispy focaccia with light melted cheese inside), which is delicious and is a must. Undaunted, everyone then seems to go on and eat the standard courses of antipasto, primo, secondo and desert! The food is very good, though, so it's not too much of a hardship. It's on the expensive side, but for the total experience it's probably worth it. <tooc, May 2005> $$
