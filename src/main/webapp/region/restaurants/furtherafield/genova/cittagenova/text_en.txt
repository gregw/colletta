There are many restaurants all over this big city, but there is a concentration of them in the old town around the porto antico (where the aquarium is located). You can also eat well at the airport.

[[http://www.itremerli.it:I Tre Merli]] (Palazzino Millo, Porto Antico) Tel 010.2464416 $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:8]]) This is right on the concourse of the porto antico, and sitting at the tables outside you get a nice view of the bay and all the comings and goings. Inside there is a beautiful large room with a very interesting and unique appearance. You can have various farinata or foccaccia dishes, but the 'ristorante' menu is fairly sophisticated and the food comes to your table looking a picture. However, the quality lives up to the appearance and the price naturally reflects this. This is a very attractive place for a long and relaxed lunch! <tooc, May 2005> $$

[Saint Cyr] (Piazza Marsala) Tel 010.886897/010.815039 $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:8]]) This is in Via Palestro, the least significant turning off Piazza Corvetto, which is on the North Eastern flank of the centro storico. There is room for a few cars in the courtyard inside the gates, but more than likely you will need to find a space in the small piazza or surrounding streets. The decor is a bit formal and dated, but stylish and immaculate nonetheless. The food has Piemontese and French influences, with very little seafood on offer. The quality is high, and this is justly reflected in the price. English is spoken.  <tooc, June 2005> $$

[[http://www.ristorantedagiacomo.it:Ristorante Da Giacomo]] (Corso Italia 1) Tel 010-311041 $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:9]]) This is on the East side of Genoa, on the beach side of the coastal road just as as starts to go up the hill beyond the Fiera. There is an adjacent car park for customers. The entrance and interior are very impressive and stylish, and the service is very courteous. The fish dishes are superb, and there is a good, reasonably priced wine list. Overall, although on the expensive side, you get excellent value here. Recommended! <tooc, November 2006> $$

[Antica Osteria di Vico Palla] (Vico Palla) Tel 010.2466575 $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:5]]) This osteria is hidden away in the back streets on the South flank of the port, not far from the Conference Centre and multistorey car park, but nevertheless it is very popular and booking is advisable. It is an old establishment, from a different age, and conditions are cramped and chaotic. However, the atmosphere is compelling and the food is simple, traditional and good. <tooc, February 2003> $$

[Ao Vegio Caroggio] (Via San Lorenzo, 43) Tel 010.2541764 $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:4]]) Via San Lorenzo is the main pedestrian thoroughfare leading from the piazza at the top of Via XX Settembre down through the old town to the port. You will normally see a queue outside this restaurant for the take-away delicacies. However, the food served upstairs is a bit of a disappointment, in spite of the fact that is recommended in many guide books. There is little atmosphere, and the best that can be said about the food is that you get large portions. A tourist trap, I would say!  <tooc, April 2004> $$

[La Rosa Self-Service] (Genoa Airport) Tel 010.6043360 $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:3]]) There are only a few dishes available here, as you would expect, and the food is straightforward, simple and cheap. However, it is very good and you can be in and out very quickly if need be. <tooc, March 2006> $$

[Il Portico] ([[http://www.sheratongenova.com/:Sheraton Hotel]], Genoa Airport) Tel 010.65491 $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:7]]) They do an excellent and good value buffet breakfast here, and you can also dine very well at lunchtime and in the evening.  <tooc, May 2004> $$

[Caffe Klainguti] (Piazza Soziglia) Tel 010.2474552 $$
You cannot go to Genoa and not seek out this historic pasticceria in the old town. The speciality is a hazelnut croissant named 'Falstaff', but everything is a delight to taste.  <tooc, November 2004> $$
