This is a medium sized coastal town, just the other side of Savona. Albissola Marina is the section around the bay on the West side.

[[http://www.lafamiliare.com:La Familiare]] (Piazza del Popolo 8, Albissola Marina) Tel 019.489480 $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:6]]) This is in a little square that faces the sea across the aurelia road. There is a small gazebo at the front and a nicely tended room inside. The accent is on fish. Friendly and family run. <tooc, Jan 2011>

[Fiore] (Corso Ferrari 7) Tel 019-485948 $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:5]]) This popular restaurant/pizzeria is on the north side of the coastal road on a corner where the river meets the sea. There are some rooms inside as you enter, and another plus an open terrace on the first floor. They make their own beer (three different types) and serve excellent pizzas, with the option of having the base made with farro (spelt). The seafood is also good. Although this is in what appears to be rather a dingy location, it is worth a visit if you are over that way. <tooc, July 2008>

[La Locanda di Nonna Teresa] (Via N.Rosselli 27, Ellera) Tel 019.49009 $$
([[/region/restaurants/reviews:5]]) This is in the small town of Ellera, about 6 km inland - come off the autostrada, bear left and follow the signs. Just as you come in to Ellera, before the bend to the right, the restaurant is down on the left, adjacent to a small piazza where you can park. There is a bar as you go in, where you will be welcomed and offered a table in the large room behind. It is a popular venue, and at lunch time many of the local workers will be enjoying a meal of typical local dishes. There is an antipaso of cold meats, beans, and cheese which you can follow with the standard range of pasta dishes and a secondo chosen from one of a number of meat dishes. The deserts are home made, including the ice cream (recommended!). At the end you will be astonished when they deliver an enormous brown bottle of grappa to the table for you to sample as you wish (and at your peril!). There is a good atmosphere here, and the price is reasonable. If you like food of the style that 'grandma' would have cooked, then you will like it here. (A piece of advice: drink plenty of water, because the food is quite salty). <tooc, March 2007> $$
