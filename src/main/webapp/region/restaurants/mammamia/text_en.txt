[tooc]:
$$Dining style: [[../reviews:3]]. This is about half way along the main street in Leca. and is much larger than you would expect from the outside. You can eat inside upstairs or downstairs, or in the outdoor space out the back. The pizzas are brought to the table on a large circular wooden board and come in small or large sizes, where small serves 2 people and large serves 4. Unusually, they are a thick, doughy style of pizza and the toppings are rather crude. Nevertheless, it is very popular. $$
