$$Dining Style: [[../reviews:6]]. This place is a little bit out of the way. Driving away from Colletta towards Albenga, fork off to go into Cisano sul Neva but take the first turning on the right, a little way after the small church. This takes you across the river, where you should immediately turn left and go along a narrow road through the woods for just over three kilometres. When you arrive at a T-junction, go left and itâ€™s on your right after about five hundred metres. $$

Alternatively, go down to the traffic lights just past the autostrada and turn right. Immediately over the bridge turn right again and keep going for a few kilometres towards Cenesi. Keep an eye out for the restaurant on your left. $$

It is both a restaurant and pizzeria, but serves no pasta. You can get fine antipasti and pizza, and very good meat and fish done on the barbecue. The lamb chops and the veal fillet are very good, and you can get a steak of horse meat (cavallo) which we are told is very tender. The mixed grill is enormous (no, there is no horse meat in it!). $$

There is seating under an awning outside, and plenty more tables inside. Alongside there is an enormous and well-kept garden area in which children love to run around and let off steam. There is a parking area on the other side, but at peak times you will need to park at the side of the raod outside.
