$$Dining Style: [[../reviews:4]]. The restaurant is in the central piazza in Cisano. This is a very popular restaurant and you will definitely have to book at peak times, even for lunch. No English is spoken, but there is a menu. The zemin di ceci (chick pea soup) and the bistecca di maiale (pork chop) are favourites of ours. Pay at the desk as you leave â€“ declare which courses you had and be amazed at how little you are charged!
