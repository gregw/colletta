$$Dining Style: [[../reviews:7]]. Costa is on the valley road in Nasino (turn right at Scola away from Albenga). No English is spoken, but some French is understood. There is no written menu, but the food is very good and very wholesome. We didnâ€™t really understand why duck and orange are supposed to go together until we found out here! Mushrooms are a speciality. If you like variety, I highly recommend the antipasto.
