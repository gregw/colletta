Via Tornatore, 195
Zuccarello

Tel. ${phone}

Closed on Monday and Tuesday, but otherwise open in the evenings and also at lunchtime on Sunday and holiday periods. If you are planning to go at a quiet time, however, it is best to phone in advance so that they are expecting you.

From Colletta, go down to the T-junction at the Tamoil petrol station and turn left. Zuccarello is about 2.5 km up the road, lying beneath the ruins of a castle on a hilltop. There is parking at both ends of the village, but the far end is closest to the restaurant.

$$Dining Style: [[../reviews:4]]. No English is spoken, but Mario and Egle will nevertheless give you a genuine welcome and treat you to some excellent home cooking. Reasonably priced. There are some tables outside in the piazza, which is nice in fine weather.
