$$Dining Style: [[../reviews:5]]. You would never know that this place existed! This restaurant/pizzeria is on the small ridge behind Centro Convenienza Esse, opposite UniEuro. At the roundbout near UniEuro turn towards Salea (left, coming from Colletta). Take the first turn left just as you start to go up the hill, ending up on a narrow track that looks like it’s going nowhere. $$

It’s a restaurant and pizzeria combined, and much nicer than you would expect for such a hidden away location. The weekday set lunch is good value.  $$

In summer there are tables outside, and live music on some evenings. <tooc, July 2006> $$
