$$Dining Style: restaurant [[../reviews:5]], brasseria [[../reviews:3]].  This is near the abbey in Conscente above Cisano Sul Neva. There is a room inside and a large area outside where they barbecue fish and meat. It is only open in the summer, but stays open late at weekends. Generally, the meat is cooked less than in England, so if you want it rare ask for 'medio' and if you want it medium ask for 'ben cotto'.
