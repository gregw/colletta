[tooc]: $$
Dining Style: [[../reviews:3]]. From Colletta, go down to the T-junction at the Tamoil petrol station and turn left. Zuccarello is about 2.5 km up the road, lying beneath the ruins of a castle on a hilltop. There is parking at both ends of the village, but this restaurant is nearer the far end. $$

The food is basic and there is only a small choice of dishes. However, you eat fairly cheaply and the room inside is quite nice. The atmosphere is spoiled, however, by a prominent and invasive TV. $$
